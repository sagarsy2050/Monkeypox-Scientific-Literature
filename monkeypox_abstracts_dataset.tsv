30981594	Human Monkeypox: Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics, Diagnosis, and Prevention	Recently, concern has been raised about the emergence of human monkeypox virus and the occasionally severe clinical presentation bearing resemblance to that of smallpox. In 2018 3 patients in the UK were diagnosed with monkeypox, and the frequency and geographic distribution of cases across West and Central Africa have increased in recent years. In Nigeria, most monkeypox patients are aged <40 years and lack cross-protective immunity because they were born after discontinuation of the smallpox eradication campaign. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of monkeypox and discusses its growing public health threat in this context.	10	Review	Epidemic; Monkeypox; Smallpox; West Africa	10.1016/j.idc.2019.03.001	Petersen E, Kantele A, Koopmans M, Asogun D, Yinka-Ogunleye A, Ihekweazu C, Zumla A.

34662033	Monkeypox	Monkeypox virus was first isolated and identified in 1958 when monkeys shipped from Singapore to a Denmark research facility fell ill. However, the first confirmed human case was in 1970 when the virus was isolated from a child in the Democratic Republic of Congo suspected to have smallpox. Coincident immunity to monkeypox virus was previously achieved with vaccinia vaccination; however, eradicating smallpox and subsequent lack of vaccination efforts paved the way for monkeypox to gain clinical relevance. Furthermore, because most cases of monkeypox occur in rural Africa, suspected underreporting may translate to an underestimation of the potential threat of this pathogen.

33167496	Monkeypox Virus in Nigeria: Infection Biology, Epidemiology, and Evolution	Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is a member of orthopoxvirus genus. The reemergence of MPXV in 2017 (at Bayelsa state) after 39 years of no reported case in Nigeria, and the export of travelers' monkeypox (MPX) from Nigeria to other parts of the world, in 2018 and 2019, respectively, have raised concern that MPXV may have emerged to occupy the ecological and immunological niche vacated by smallpox virus. This review X-rays the current state of knowledge pertaining the infection biology, epidemiology, and evolution of MPXV in Nigeria and worldwide, especially with regard to the human, cellular, and viral factors that modulate the virus transmission dynamics, infection, and its maintenance in nature. This paper also elucidates the role of recombination, gene loss and gene gain in MPXV evolution, chronicles the role of signaling in MPXV infection, and reviews the current therapeutic options available for the treatment and prevention of MPX. Additionally, genome-wide phylogenetic analysis was undertaken, and we show that MPXV isolates from recent 2017 outbreak in Nigeria were monophyletic with the isolate exported to Israel from Nigeria but do not share the most recent common ancestor with isolates obtained from earlier outbreaks, in 1971 and 1978, respectively. Finally, the review highlighted gaps in knowledge particularly the non-identification of a definitive reservoir host animal for MPXV and proposed future research endeavors to address the unresolved questions.	3	Review	Nigeria; Poxviridae; antiviral drugs; epidemiology; gene loss; monkeypox viruses; orthopoxviruses; phylogeny; recombination; signaling	10.3390/v12111257	Alakunle E, Moens U, Nchinda G, Okeke MI.

24158414	Human monkeypox	Human monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus with a presentation similar to smallpox. Clinical differentiation of the disease from smallpox and varicella is difficult. Laboratory diagnostics are principal components to identification and surveillance of disease, and new tests are needed for a more precise and rapid diagnosis. The majority of human infections occur in Central Africa, where surveillance in rural areas with poor infrastructure is difficult but can be accomplished with evidence-guided tools and educational materials to inform public health workers of important principles. Contemporary epidemiological studies are needed now that populations do not receive routine smallpox vaccination. New therapeutics and vaccines offer hope for the treatment and prevention of monkeypox; however, more research must be done before they are ready to be deployed in an endemic setting. There is a need for more research in the epidemiology, ecology, and biology of the virus in endemic areas to better understand and prevent human infections.	48	Review	Orthopoxvirus; monkeypox; smallpox	10.1093/cid/cit703	McCollum AM, Damon IK.

30445121	Vaccinating against monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	Healthcare-associated transmission of monkeypox has been observed on multiple occasions in areas where the disease is endemic. Data collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from an ongoing CDC-supported program of enhanced surveillance in the Tshuapa Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the annual incidence of human monkeypox is estimated to be 3.5-5/10,000, suggests that there is approximately one healthcare worker infection for every 100 confirmed monkeypox cases. Herein, we describe a study that commenced in February 2017, the intent of which is to evaluate the effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of a third-generation smallpox vaccine, IMVAMUNE®, in healthcare personnel at risk of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection. We describe procedures for documenting exposures to monkeypox virus infection in study participants, and outline lessons learned that may be of relevance for studies of other investigational medical countermeasures in hard to reach, under-resourced populations.	5	Review	Clinical trial; Democratic Republic of the Congo; IMVAMUNE; Monkeypox; Smallpox vaccine	10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.11.004	Petersen BW, Kabamba J, McCollum AM, Lushima RS, Wemakoy EO, Muyembe Tamfum JJ, Nguete B, Hughes CM, Monroe BP, Reynolds MG.

35148313	The changing epidemiology of human monkeypox-A potential threat? A systematic review	Monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, results in a smallpox-like disease in humans. Since monkeypox in humans was initially diagnosed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), it has spread to other regions of Africa (primarily West and Central), and cases outside Africa have emerged in recent years. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature on how monkeypox epidemiology has evolved, with particular emphasis on the number of confirmed, probable, and/or possible cases, age at presentation, mortality, and geographical spread. The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020208269). We identified 48 peer-reviewed articles and 18 grey literature sources for data extraction. The number of human monkeypox cases has been on the rise since the 1970s, with the most dramatic increases occurring in the DRC. The median age at presentation has increased from 4 (1970s) to 21 years (2010-2019). There was an overall case fatality rate of 8.7%, with a significant difference between clades-Central African 10.6% (95% CI: 8.4%- 13.3%) vs. West African 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%- 6.8%). Since 2003, import- and travel-related spread outside of Africa has occasionally resulted in outbreaks. Interactions/activities with infected animals or individuals are risk behaviors associated with acquiring monkeypox. Our review shows an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from young children to young adults. These findings may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, leading to increased human-to-human transmission. The appearance of outbreaks beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease. Increased surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases are essential tools for understanding the continuously changing epidemiology of this resurging disease.	1	Meta-Analysis	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0010141	Bunge EM, Hoet B, Chen L, Lienert F, Weidenthaler H, Baer LR, Steffen R.

30234087	Emergence of Monkeypox as the Most Important Orthopoxvirus Infection in Humans	Monkeypox is an emerging zoonotic disease recognized as the most important orthopoxvirus infection in humans in the smallpox post-eradication era. The clinical presentation of monkeypox is similar to the one of smallpox. The case fatality rate of monkeypox (10%) lies between the case fatality rate of variola major (30%) and variola minor (1%). The disease is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but other countries of Central and West Africa either reported cases of monkeypox in humans or circulation in wildlife. The disease was also imported once into the USA. The disease has always been considered rare and self-limiting, however recent sporadic reports suggest otherwise. Unfortunately, the collected data is limited, dispersed and often incomplete. Therefore, the objective of this review is to trace all reported human monkeypox outbreaks and relevant epidemiological information. The frequency and geographical spread of human monkeypox cases have increased in recent years, and there are huge gaps in our understanding of the disease's emergence, epidemiology, and ecology. The monkeypox virus is considered a high threat pathogen causing a disease of public health importance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to focus on building surveillance capacities which will provide valuable information for designing appropriate prevention, preparedness and response activities.	21	Review	disease outbreaks; emerging infectious diseases; monkeypox; one health; orthopoxvirus; zoonosis	10.3389/fpubh.2018.00241	Sklenovská N, Van Ranst M.

30357851	A review of the monkeypox virus and a recent outbreak of skin rash disease in Nigeria	Since the eradication of smallpox approximately 39 years ago, monkeypox virus remains the most pathogenic poxvirus, being mainly restricted to Central and West Africa. Before 1970, there were no reports of human monkeypox in Nigeria, while between 1971 and 1978 there were three cases, with none having been reported thereafter. However, in September 2017, a case of contagious skin rash disease, typical of monkeypox, was observed in an 11-year-old boy from the southern part of the country and confirmed to be associated with the monkeypox virus. This large outbreak consisted of 262 suspected, 115 confirmed cases, and 7 mortalities across 26 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The aim of this manuscript is to provide an updated, comprehensive, and timely review of monkeypox, an important emerging infection in Nigeria. Monkeypox is now a major threat to global health security, requiring an urgent multidisciplinary approach involving veterinarians, physicians, virologists, and public health experts to fast-track the development of diagnostic assays, vaccines, antivirals, and other control strategies.	4	Review	Africa; Nigeria; antipoxvirus agents; epidemiology; infectious diseases; monkeypox; outbreak; poxviruses; re-emerging infection; zoonotic	10.1002/jmv.25348	Kabuga AI, El Zowalaty ME.

30453097	Monkeypox - Enhancing public health preparedness for an emerging lethal human zoonotic epidemic threat in the wake of the smallpox post-eradication era	The identification of monkeypox in 3 separate patients in the United Kingdom in September raised media and political attention on an emerging public health threat. Nigeria, whose last confirmed case of monkeypox was in 1978, is currently experiencing an unusually large and outbreak of human monkeypox cases, a 'One Human-Environmental-Animal Health' approach is being effectively used to define and tackle the outbreak. As of 13th October 2018, there have been one hundred and sixteen confirmed cases the majority of whom are under 40 years. Over the past 20 years ten Central and West African countries have reported monkeypox cases which have risen exponentially. We review the history and evolution of monkeypox outbreaks in Africa and USA, the changing clinical presentations, and discuss possible factors underlying the increasing numbers being detected including the cessation of smallpox vaccination programs. Major knowledge gaps remain on the epidemiology, host reservoir, and emergence, transmission, pathogenesis and prevention of monkeypoz.	9	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.ijid.2018.11.008	Petersen E, Abubakar I, Ihekweazu C, Heymann D, Ntoumi F, Blumberg L, Asogun D, Mukonka V, Lule SA, Bates M, Honeyborne I, Mfinanga S, Mwaba P, Dar O, Vairo F, Mukhtar M, Kock R, McHugh TD, Ippolito G, Zumla A.

33756100	Reemergence of Human Monkeypox and Declining Population Immunity in the Context of Urbanization, Nigeria, 2017-2020	A monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria during 2017-2020 provides an illustrative case study for emerging zoonoses. We built a statistical model to simulate declining immunity from monkeypox at 2 levels: At the individual level, we used a constant rate of decline in immunity of 1.29% per year as smallpox vaccination rates fell. At the population level, the cohort of vaccinated residents decreased over time because of deaths and births. By 2016, only 10.1% of the total population in Nigeria was vaccinated against smallpox; the serologic immunity level was 25.7% among vaccinated persons and 2.6% in the overall population. The substantial resurgence of monkeypox in Nigeria in 2017 appears to have been driven by a combination of population growth, accumulation of unvaccinated cohorts, and decline in smallpox vaccine immunity. The expanding unvaccinated population means that entire households, not just children, are now more susceptible to monkeypox, increasing risk of human-to-human transmission.	5	Review	Nigeria; West Africa; human-to-human transmission; immunity; immunoglobulin; monkeypox; neutralizing antibodies; reemerging diseases; smallpox; urbanization; vaccination; viruses; waning immunity; zoonoses	10.3201/eid2704.203569	Nguyen PY, Ajisegiri WS, Costantino V, Chughtai AA, MacIntyre CR.

32880628	Exportation of Monkeypox Virus From the African Continent	Background: The largest West African monkeypox outbreak began September 2017, in Nigeria. Four individuals traveling from Nigeria to the United Kingdom (n = 2), Israel (n = 1), and Singapore (n = 1) became the first human monkeypox cases exported from Africa, and a related nosocomial transmission event in the United Kingdom became the first confirmed human-to-human monkeypox transmission event outside of Africa. Methods: Epidemiological and molecular data for exported and Nigerian cases were analyzed jointly to better understand the exportations in the temporal and geographic context of the outbreak. Results: Isolates from all travelers and a Bayelsa case shared a most recent common ancestor and traveled to Bayelsa, Delta, or Rivers states. Genetic variation for this cluster was lower than would be expected from a random sampling of genomes from this outbreak, but data did not support direct links between travelers. Conclusions: Monophyly of exportation cases and the Bayelsa sample, along with the intermediate levels of genetic variation, suggest a small pool of related isolates is the likely source for the exported infections. This may be the result of the level of genetic variation present in monkeypox isolates circulating within the contiguous region of Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers states, or another more restricted, yet unidentified source pool.	8	Information Unavailable	border health; exportation; haplotype networks; monkeypox virus; travel epidemiology; viral genomes	10.1093/infdis/jiaa559	Mauldin MR, McCollum AM, Nakazawa YJ, Mandra A, Whitehouse ER, Davidson W, Zhao H, Gao J, Li Y, Doty J, Yinka-Ogunleye A, Akinpelu A, Aruna O, Naidoo D, Lewandowski K, Afrough B, Graham V, Aarons E, Hewson R, Vipond R, Dunning J, Chand M, Brown C, Cohen-Gihon I, Erez N, Shifman O, Israeli O, Sharon M, Schwartz E, Beth-Din A, Zvi A, Mak TM, Ng YK, Cui L, Lin RTP, Olson VA, Brooks T, Paran N, Ihekweazu C, Reynolds MG.

35623380	Clinical features and management of human monkeypox: a retrospective observational study in the UK	Background: Cases of human monkeypox are rarely seen outside of west and central Africa. There are few data regarding viral kinetics or the duration of viral shedding and no licensed treatments. Two oral drugs, brincidofovir and tecovirimat, have been approved for treatment of smallpox and have demonstrated efficacy against monkeypox in animals. Our aim was to describe the longitudinal clinical course of monkeypox in a high-income setting, coupled with viral dynamics, and any adverse events related to novel antiviral therapies. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we report the clinical features, longitudinal virological findings, and response to off-label antivirals in seven patients with monkeypox who were diagnosed in the UK between 2018 and 2021, identified through retrospective case-note review. This study included all patients who were managed in dedicated high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) centres in Liverpool, London, and Newcastle, coordinated via a national HCID network. Findings: We reviewed all cases since the inception of the HCID (airborne) network between Aug 15, 2018, and Sept 10, 2021, identifying seven patients. Of the seven patients, four were men and three were women. Three acquired monkeypox in the UK: one patient was a health-care worker who acquired the virus nosocomially, and one patient who acquired the virus abroad transmitted it to an adult and child within their household cluster. Notable disease features included viraemia, prolonged monkeypox virus DNA detection in upper respiratory tract swabs, reactive low mood, and one patient had a monkeypox virus PCR-positive deep tissue abscess. Five patients spent more than 3 weeks (range 22-39 days) in isolation due to prolonged PCR positivity. Three patients were treated with brincidofovir (200 mg once a week orally), all of whom developed elevated liver enzymes resulting in cessation of therapy. One patient was treated with tecovirimat (200mg twice daily for 2 weeks orally), experienced no adverse effects, and had a shorter duration of viral shedding and illness (10 days hospitalisation) compared with the other six patients. One patient experienced a mild relapse 6 weeks after hospital discharge. Interpretation: Human monkeypox poses unique challenges, even to well resourced health-care systems with HCID networks. Prolonged upper respiratory tract viral DNA shedding after skin lesion resolution challenged current infection prevention and control guidance. There is an urgent need for prospective studies of antivirals for this disease.

32417140	Human monkeypox - After 40 years, an unintended consequence of smallpox eradication	Smallpox eradication, coordinated by the WHO and certified 40 years ago, led to the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination in most countries. It is estimated that over 70% of the world's population is no longer protected against smallpox, and through cross-immunity, to closely related orthopox viruses such as monkeypox. Monkeypox is now a re-emerging disease. Monkeypox is endemic in as yet unconfirmed animal reservoirs in sub-Saharan Africa, while its human epidemiology appears to be changing. Monkeypox in small animals imported from Ghana as exotic pets was at the origin of an outbreak of human monkeypox in the USA in 2003. Travellers infected in Nigeria were at the origin of monkeypox cases in the UK in 2018 and 2019, Israel in 2018 and Singapore in2019. Together with sporadic reports of human infections with other orthopox viruses, these facts invite speculation that emergent or re-emergent human monkeypox might fill the epidemiological niche vacated by smallpox. An ad-hoc and unofficial group of interested experts met to consider these issues at Chatham House, London in June 2019, in order to review available data and identify monkeypox-related research gaps. Gaps identified by the experts included:The experts further agreed on the need for a better understanding of the genomic evolution and changing epidemiology of orthopox viruses, the usefulness of in-field genomic diagnostics, and the best disease control strategies, including the possibility of vaccination with new generation non-replicating smallpox vaccines and treatment with recently developed antivirals.	7	Information Unavailable	Epidemiology; Eradication; Monkeypox; Orthopox; Risk; Smallpox; Vaccines	10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.062	Simpson K, Heymann D, Brown CS, Edmunds WJ, Elsgaard J, Fine P, Hochrein H, Hoff NA, Green A, Ihekweazu C, Jones TC, Lule S, Maclennan J, McCollum A, Mühlemann B, Nightingale E, Ogoina D, Ogunleye A, Petersen B, Powell J, Quantick O, Rimoin AW, Ulaeato D, Wapling A.

16731033	Detection of monkeypox virus with real-time PCR assays	Background: Human monkeypox, a zoonotic disease, was first reported outside of Africa during the 2003 US outbreak. Objectives: We present two real-time PCR assays critical for laboratory diagnosis of monkeypox during the 2003 US outbreak. Study design: A TaqMan-based assay (E9L-NVAR) targets the orthopoxvirus DNA polymerase gene and detects Eurasian orthopoxviruses other than Variola. A hybridization assay, utilizing a MGB Eclipsetrade mark (Epoch Biosciences) probe, targets an envelope protein gene (B6R) and specifically detects monkeypox virus (MPXV). Assays were validated using coded orthopoxvirus DNA samples and used to evaluate lesion samples from five confirmed US monkeypox cases. Results: E9L-NVAR did not detect variola (48 strains), North American orthopoxviruses (2), or DNA derived from non-poxviral rash illnesses. The assay reproducibly identified various concentrations of 13 Eurasian orthopoxvirus strains and was sensitive to 12.5 vaccinia genomes. The B6R assay recognized 15 different MPXV strains, while other orthopoxvirus (9) and bacteria (15) strains did not cross-react. Of the 13 human samples tested from confirmed cases, both assays identified 100% as containing MPXV DNA. Conclusions: E9L-NVAR and B6R assays demonstrate 100% specificity for non-variola Eurasian orthopoxvirus and MPXV, respectively. Using two discrete viral gene targets, these assays together provide a reliable and sensitive method for quickly confirming monkeypox infections.	50	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jcv.2006.03.012	Li Y, Olson VA, Laue T, Laker MT, Damon IK.

31285143	Outbreak of human monkeypox in Nigeria in 2017-18: a clinical and epidemiological report	Background: In September, 2017, human monkeypox re-emerged in Nigeria, 39 years after the last reported case. We aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of the 2017-18 human monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria. Methods: We reviewed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cases of human monkeypox that occurred between Sept 22, 2017, and Sept 16, 2018. Data were collected with a standardised case investigation form, with a case definition of human monkeypox that was based on previously established guidelines. Diagnosis was confirmed by viral identification with real-time PCR and by detection of positive anti-orthopoxvirus IgM antibodies. Whole-genome sequencing was done for seven cases. Haplotype analysis results, genetic distance data, and epidemiological data were used to infer a likely series of events for potential human-to-human transmission of the west African clade of monkeypox virus. Findings: 122 confirmed or probable cases of human monkeypox were recorded in 17 states, including seven deaths (case fatality rate 6%). People infected with monkeypox virus were aged between 2 days and 50 years (median 29 years [IQR 14]), and 84 (69%) were male. All 122 patients had vesiculopustular rash, and fever, pruritus, headache, and lymphadenopathy were also common. The rash affected all parts of the body, with the face being most affected. The distribution of cases and contacts suggested both primary zoonotic and secondary human-to-human transmission. Two cases of health-care-associated infection were recorded. Genomic analysis suggested multiple introductions of the virus and a single introduction along with human-to-human transmission in a prison facility. Interpretation: This study describes the largest documented human outbreak of the west African clade of the monkeypox virus. Our results suggest endemicity of monkeypox virus in Nigeria, with some evidence of human-to-human transmission. Further studies are necessary to explore animal reservoirs and risk factors for transmission of the virus in Nigeria.

31618206	A systematic review of the epidemiology of human monkeypox outbreaks and implications for outbreak strategy	Monkeypox is a vesicular-pustular illness that carries a secondary attack rate in the order of 10% in contacts unvaccinated against smallpox. Case fatality rates range from 1 to 11%, but scarring and other sequelae are common in survivors. It continues to cause outbreaks in remote populations in Central and West Africa, in areas with poor access and weakened or disrupted surveillance capacity and information networks. Recent outbreaks in Nigeria (2017-18) and Cameroon (2018) have occurred where monkeypox has not been reported for over 20 years. This has prompted concerns over whether there have been changes in the biology and epidemiology of the disease that may in turn have implications for how outbreaks and cases should best be managed. A systematic review was carried out to examine reported data on human monkeypox outbreaks over time, and to identify if and how epidemiology has changed. Published and grey literature were critically analysed, and data extracted to inform recommendations on outbreak response, use of case definitions and public health advice. The level of detail, validity of data, geographical coverage and consistency of reporting varied considerably across the 71 monkeypox outbreak documents obtained. An increase in cases reported over time was supported by literature from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were insufficient to measure trends in secondary attack rates and case fatality rates. Phylogenetic analyses consistently identify two strains of the virus without evidence of emergence of a new strain. Understanding of monkeypox virulence with regard to clinical presentation by strain is minimal, with infrequent sample collection and laboratory analysis. A variety of clinical and surveillance case definitions are described in the literature: two definitions have been formally evaluated and showed high sensitivity but low specificity. These were specific to a Congo-Basin (CB) strain-affected area of the DRC where they were used. Evidence on use of antibiotics for prophylaxis against secondary cutaneous infection is anecdotal and limited. Current evidence suggests there has been an increase in total monkeypox cases reported by year in the DRC irrespective of advancements in the national Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system. There has been a marked increase in number of individual monkeypox outbreak reports, from outside the DRC in between 2010 and 2018, particularly in the Central African Republic (CAR) although this does not necessarily indicate an increase in annual cases over time in these areas. The geographical pattern reported in the Nigeria outbreak suggests a possible new and widespread zoonotic reservoir requiring further investigation and research. With regards to outbreak response, increased attention is warranted for high-risk patient groups, and nosocomial transmission risks. The animal reservoir remains unknown and there is a dearth of literature informing case management and successful outbreak response strategies. Up-to-date complete, consistent and longer-term research is sorely needed to inform and guide evidence-based response and management of monkeypox outbreaks.	12	Meta-Analysis	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0007791	Beer EM, Rao VB.

22188935	Whither monkeypox vaccination	Monkeypox (MPX) is a virulent orthopoxvirus that is endemic in some regions of Central Africa. MPX incidence has been rising since the cessation of routine smallpox immunization. While it causes significant disease, there is limited person-to-person spread, the incidence is still relatively low, and cases are generally restricted to remote areas that are difficult to access. Therefore, initiating vaccine trials or implementing vaccination programs would be challenging. This paper considers the factors that may influence future decisions on whether MPX vaccination should be pursued.	2	Review	Orthopoxvirus; biodefense; smallpox; vaccine; variola	10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.09.004	Rimoin AW, Graham BS.

30625020	Monkeypox re-emergence in Africa: a call to expand the concept and practice of One Health	Monkeypox is a re-emerging viral zoonosis that occurs naturally in heavily forested regions of West and Central Africa. Inter-human transmission of monkeypox virus, although limited, drives outbreaks, particularly in household and health-care settings. But the available evidence suggests that without repeated zoonotic introductions, human infections would eventually cease to occur. Therefore, interrupting virus transmission from animals to humans is key to combating this disease. Areas covered: Herein we review laboratory and field studies examining the susceptibility of various animal taxa to monkeypox virus infection, and note the competence of various species to serve as reservoirs or transmission hosts. In addition, we discuss early socio-ecologic theories of monkeypox virus transmission in rural settings and review current modes of ecologic investigation - including ecologic niche modeling, and ecologic sampling - in light of their potential to identify specific animal species and features of the environment that are associated with heightened risk for human disease. Expert opinion: The role of disease ecology and scientific research in ongoing disease prevention efforts should be reinforced, particularly for wildlife-associated zoonoses such as monkeypox. Such efforts alongside those aimed at nurturing 'One Health' collaborations may ultimately hold the greatest promise for reducing human infections with this pathogen.	14	Review	Monkeypox; One Health; orthopoxvirus; zoonosis; 	10.1080/14787210.2019.1567330	Reynolds MG, Doty JB, McCollum AM, Olson VA, Nakazawa Y.

18394820	[Human monkeypox]	Unlike other recent viral emergences, which were in majority caused by RNA viruses, the monkeypox results from infection by a DNA virus, an orthopoxvirus closely related to both vaccine and smallpox viruses and whose two genomic variants are known. Unexpectedly isolated from captive Asiatic monkeys and first considered as an laboratory curiosity, this virus was recognised in 1970 as an human pathogen in tropical Africa. Here it was responsible for sporadic cases following intrusions (for hunting) into tropical rain forests or rare outbreak with human-to-human transmission as observed in 1996 in Democratic Republic of Congo. As monkeypox in humans is not distinguishable from smallpox (a disease globally eradicated in 1977) it was only subjected to vigilant epidemiological surveillance and not considered as a potential threat outside Africa. This point of view radically changed in 2003 when monkeypox was introduced in the USA by African wild rodents and spread to 11 different states of this country. Responsible for 82 infections in American children and adults, this outbreak led to realize the sanitary hazards resulting from international trade of exotic animals and scientific investigations increasing extensively our knowledge of this zoonosis.	1	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.patbio.2008.02.006	Chastel C.

20643162	Real-time PCR assays for the specific detection of monkeypox virus West African and Congo Basin strain DNA	Orthopoxvirus monkeypox (MPXV) forms two distinct clades: the MPXV Congo Basin clade viruses are endemic in the Congo Basin, human illness typically presents with symptoms similar to discrete, ordinary smallpox and has a case fatality rate of approximately 10% in unvaccinated populations; the MPXV West African clade viruses have been isolated in West Africa and appear to cause a less severe, and less inter-human transmissible disease. Recently, monkeypox outbreaks were reported in US and Sudan caused by MPXV West African and Congo Basin strains respectively. These events demonstrated the ability and trend of the virus to exploit new hosts and emerge globally; it also emphasizes the need for the diagnosis of MPXV, especially the ability to distinguish between Congo Basin and West African monkeypox strains. In this study, three new real-time PCR assays based on TaqMan probe technology were reported: the MPXV West African specific, Congo Basin strain specific and MPXV generic assays. The new assays demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity in the validation study with multiple platforms and various PCR reagent kits, and will improve the rapid detection and differentiation of monkeypox infections from other rash illness.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.07.012	Li Y, Zhao H, Wilkins K, Hughes C, Damon IK.

28406414	Review of poxvirus: emergence of monkeypox	This article reviews the different types of poxvirus infections. Smallpox, although eradicated, must continue to be monitored because of the potential risk of accidental or voluntary (by bioterrorism) reintroduction. Monkeypox and cowpox viruses are considered to be emergent today ; their high risk of dissemination is due to the increase in international transport as well as trends for new animals as pets and the loss of vaccinal protection against smallpox. Molluscum contagiosum (molluscipoxvirus) causes mild infections, is particularly frequent in children ; in adults it is a marker of the risk of sexually transmitted infections and can, in cases with profuse lesions, reveal AIDS.	1	Review	cowpox; molluscum contagiosum; monkeypox; orf; poxvirus; smallpox; vaccinia	10.1684/mst.2017.0653	Morand A, Delaigue S, Morand JJ.

35389974	Monkeypox in a Traveler Returning from Nigeria - Dallas, Texas, July 2021	Monkeypox is a rare, sometimes life-threatening zoonotic infection that occurs in west and central Africa. It is caused by Monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus similar to Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) and Vaccinia virus (the live virus component of orthopoxvirus vaccines) and can spread to humans. After 39 years without detection of human disease in Nigeria, an outbreak involving 118 confirmed cases was identified during 2017-2018 (1); sporadic cases continue to occur. During September 2018-May 2021, six unrelated persons traveling from Nigeria received diagnoses of monkeypox in non-African countries: four in the United Kingdom and one each in Israel and Singapore. In July 2021, a man who traveled from Lagos, Nigeria, to Dallas, Texas, became the seventh traveler to a non-African country with diagnosed monkeypox. Among 194 monitored contacts, 144 (74%) were flight contacts. The patient received tecovirimat, an antiviral for treatment of orthopoxvirus infections, and his home required large-scale decontamination. Whole genome sequencing showed that the virus was consistent with a strain of Monkeypox virus known to circulate in Nigeria, but the specific source of the patient's infection was not identified. No epidemiologically linked cases were reported in Nigeria; no contact received postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the orthopoxvirus vaccine ACAM2000.

30270859	Human Monkeypox: Current State of Knowledge and Implications for the Future	"The zoonosis human monkeypox (MPX) was discovered in 1970, twelve years after the discovery of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in a Danish laboratory in 1958. Historically confined to West Africa (WA) and the Congo basin (CB), new epidemics in Sudan and the United States of America (USA) have fuelled new research highlighting environmental factors contributing to the expanded geographical spread of monkeypox virus (MPXV). A systematic literature review was conducted in MEDLINE® (Ovid), MEDLINE® (PubMed) and Google Scholar databases using the search terms: monkeypox, MPXV and ""human monkeypox"". The literature revealed MPX has classic prodromal symptoms followed by a total body rash. The sole distinguishing clinical characteristic from other pox-like illnesses is the profound lymphadenopathy. Laboratory diagnosis of MPX is essential, a suitable test for endemic areas is under development but not yet available. For the time being anti-poxvirus antibodies in an unvaccinated individual with a history of severe illness and rash can suggest MPX infection. The reservoir host remains elusive yet the rope squirrel and Gambian pouched rat appear to be the most likely candidates. Transmission includes fomite, droplet, direct contact with infected humans or animals and consumption of infected meat. Though smallpox vaccination is protective against MPXV, new non-immune generations contribute to increasing incidence. Environmental factors are increasing the frequency of contact with potential hosts, thus increasing the risk of animal-to-human transmission. Increased risk of transmission through globalisation, conflict and environmental influences makes MPX a more realistic threat to previously unaffected countries. Health worker training and further development and accessibility of suitable diagnostic tests, vaccinations and anti-viral treatment is becoming increasingly necessary."	9	Review	MPX; MPXV; human monkeypox; monkeypox	10.3390/tropicalmed1010008	Brown K, Leggat PA.

34667829	Transmission dynamics of Monkeypox virus: a mathematical modelling approach	Monkeypox (MPX), similar to both smallpox and cowpox, is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). It occurs mostly in remote Central and West African communities, close to tropical rain forests. It is caused by the monkeypox virus in the Poxviridae family, which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus. We develop and analyse a deterministic mathematical model for the monkeypox virus. Both local and global asymptotic stability conditions for disease-free and endemic equilibria are determined. It is shown that the model undergo backward bifurcation, where the locally stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with an endemic equilibrium. Furthermore, we determine conditions under which the disease-free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, numerical simulations to demonstrate our findings and brief discussions are provided. The findings indicate that isolation of infected individuals in the human population helps to reduce disease transmission.

17661673	Human monkeypox: an emerging zoonotic disease	Zoonotic monkeypox virus is maintained in a large number of rodent and, to a lesser extent, nonhuman primate species in West and central Africa. Although monkeypox virus was discovered in 1958, the prototypic human cases were not witnessed until the early 1970s. Before this time, it is assumed that infections were masked by smallpox, which was then widely endemic. Nevertheless, since the 1970s, reported monkeypox virus infections of humans have escalated, as have outbreaks with reported human-to-human transmission. This increase is likely due to numerous factors, such as enhanced surveillance efforts, environmental degradation and human urbanization of areas where monkeypox virus is maintained in its animal reservoir(s) and, consequently, serve as a nidus for human infection. Furthermore, viral genetic predispositions enable monkeypox virus to infect many animal species, represented in expansive geographic ranges. Monkeypox virus was once restricted to specific regions of Africa, but its environ has expanded, in one case intercontinentally--suggesting that human monkeypox infections could continue to intensify. As a zoonotic agent, monkeypox virus is far less sensitive to typical eradication measures since it is maintained in wild-animal populations. Moreover, human vaccination is becoming a less viable option to control poxvirus infections in today's increasingly immunocompromised population, particularly with the emergence of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. An increased frequency of human monkeypox virus infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals, may permit monkeypox virus to evolve and maintain itself independently in human populations.	81	Review	Information Unavailable	10.2217/17460913.2.1.17	Parker S, Nuara A, Buller RM, Schultz DA.

18837778	Monkeypox virus and insights into its immunomodulatory proteins	Monkeypox is a disease that is endemic in Central and Western Africa. However, in 2003, there was an outbreak in the United States, representing the first documented monkeypox cases in the Western hemisphere. Although monkeypox virus is less fatal and not as transmissible as variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, there is concern that monkeypox virus could become a more efficient human pathogen. The reason for this may lie in the virus' genetic makeup, ecological changes, changes in host behavior, and the fact that with the eradication of variola virus, routine smallpox vaccination is no longer carried out. In this review, we focus on the viral proteins that are predicted to modulate the host immune response and compare the genome of monkeypox virus with the genomes of variola virus and the vaccinia virus, the orthopoxvirus that represented the smallpox vaccine. There are differences found in several of these immune-modulating genes including genes that express proteins that affect cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon. There are also differences in genes that code for virulence factors and host range proteins. Genetic differences likely also explain the differences in virulence between two strains of monkeypox virus found in two different regions of Africa. In the current setting of limited smallpox vaccination and little orthopoxvirus immunity in parts of the world, monkeypox could become a more efficient human pathogen under the right circumstances.	23	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00691.x	Weaver JR, Isaacs SN.

32341480	Monkeypox virus emergence in wild chimpanzees reveals distinct clinical outcomes and viral diversity	Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease on the rise across endemic habitats. Despite the growing importance of monkeypox virus, our knowledge on its host spectrum and sylvatic maintenance is limited. Here, we describe the recent repeated emergence of monkeypox virus in a wild, human-habituated western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus, hereafter chimpanzee) population from Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. Through daily monitoring, we show that further to causing its typical exanthematous syndrome, monkeypox can present itself as a severe respiratory disease without a diffuse rash. By analysing 949 non-invasively collected samples, we identify the circulation of at least two distinct monkeypox virus lineages and document the shedding of infectious particles in faeces and flies, suggesting that they could mediate indirect transmission. We also show that the carnivorous component of the Taï chimpanzees' diet, mainly consisting of the sympatric monkeys they regularly hunt, did not change nor shift towards rodent consumption (the presumed reservoir) before the outbreaks, suggesting that the sudden emergence of monkeypox virus in this population is probably due to changes in the ecology of the virus itself. Using long-term mortality surveillance data from Taï National Park, we provide evidence of little to no prior viral activity over at least two decades. We conclude that great ape sentinel systems devoted to the longitudinal collection of behavioural and health data can help clarify the epidemiology and clinical presentation of zoonotic pathogens.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/s41564-020-0706-0	Patrono LV, Pléh K, Samuni L, Ulrich M, Röthemeier C, Sachse A, Muschter S, Nitsche A, Couacy-Hymann E, Boesch C, Wittig RM, Calvignac-Spencer S, Leendertz FH.

14720564	Human monkeypox: an emerging zoonosis	Human monkeypox is a rare viral zoonosis endemic to central and western Africa that has recently emerged in the USA. Laboratory diagnosis is important because the virus can cause disease that is clinically indistinguishable from other pox-like illnesses, particularly smallpox and chickenpox. Although the natural animal reservoir of the monkeypox virus is unknown, rodents are the probable source of its introduction into the USA. A clear understanding of the virulence and transmissibility of human monkeypox has been limited by inconsistencies in epidemiological investigations. Monkeypox is the most important orthopoxvirus infection in human beings since the eradication of smallpox in the 1970s. There is currently no proven treatment for human monkeypox, and questions about its potential as an agent of bioterrorism persist.	96	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s1473-3099(03)00856-9	Di Giulio DB, Eckburg PB.

35652133	Re-emerging human monkeypox: a major public-health debacle	A multi-country outbreak of the monkeypox virus has gained global attention. As of 25 May, 250 confirmed human monkeypox cases have been reported globally. Monkeypox is caused by the Monkeypox virus, which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus and Poxviridae family. Monkeypox is often a self-limiting infection, with symptoms lasting 2 to 4 weeks with the case fatality ratio around 3-6%. Monkeypox is transmitted to humans by direct contact with an infected person or animal or contact with virus-contaminated material. Human monkeypox infections may lead to various medical complications such as fever, rash, and lymphadenopathies. Pneumonitis, encephalitis, sight-threatening keratitis, and subsequent bacterial infections are all possible complications of monkeypox. An antiviral agent developed to treat smallpox has also been approved for use in the treatment of monkeypox in the USA. Vaccines used in the smallpox eradication program also provided immunity to monkeypox. Newer vaccines have been developed, one of which has been approved for monkeypox prevention. In this article, we provide information about the recent outbreaks of human monkeypox, epidemiology, transmission pattern, possible diagnosis techniques, therapeutics, and available preventive strategies.

16908354	Monkeypox: an epidemiologic and clinical comparison of African and US disease	Monkeypox is a double-stranded DNA virus and a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus. Human monkeypox was first identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) in 1970. The first outbreak in the western hemisphere occurred in the spring of 2003. Important epidemiologic and clinical differences exist between human monkeypox in the United States and in Africa, including sex distribution, case fatality, morphology of skin lesions, and associated lymphadenopathy. These divergent clinical presentations could be caused by mode of transmission (skin inoculation vs ingestion), the skin color of affected patients, the training backgrounds of those who saw and documented disease outbreaks, the virulence of monkeypox strains involved, nutritional status, access to advanced medical care, and the prevalence of prior smallpox vaccinations.	7	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jaad.2006.05.061	Sale TA, Melski JW, Stratman EJ.

22185831	Status of human monkeypox: clinical disease, epidemiology and research	"Monkeypox, a vesiculo-pustular rash illness, was initially discovered to cause human infection in 1970 through the World Health Organization (WHO)-sponsored efforts of the Commission to Certify Smallpox Eradication in Western Africa and the Congo Basin. The virus had been discovered to cause a nonhuman primate rash illness in 1958, and was thus named monkeypox. The causative agents of monkeypox and smallpox diseases both are species of Orthopoxvirus. Orthopoxvirus monkeypox, when it infects humans as an epizootic, produces a similar clinical picture to that of ordinary human smallpox. Since 1970, extensive epidemiology, virology, ecology and public health research has enabled better characterization of monkeypox virus and the associated human disease.

32000354	Assessment of media reportage of monkeypox in southern Nigeria	Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease. Media campaigns are planned to create awareness about the disease. This is because mass media is often the leading source of information and mobilization during important health issues or crisis. The main objective of this study was to assess the media coverage of monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria.The study adopted a cross-sectional survey of residents in Southern Nigeria. A total of 600 respondents were sampled for this study through a multi-stage cluster random sampling technique. Research assistants helped in collecting data from respondents through structured questionnaire. The data collected was analyzed using percentages, mean score, and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA).Respondents had little or no knowledge of monkeypox virus, its nature, mode of transmission, and prevention mechanism (2.30 ± .918, P = .000). Respondents stated that they learnt about the virus through friends and social institutions instead of media (4.44 ± .945, P = .006). Media failed to create effective and comprehensive awareness campaigns to mobilize the public (1.86 ± 1.196, P = .001), while inappropriate and insufficient media programs and lack of funds were blamed for media ineffectiveness (4.18 ± 1.352, P = .004).The outbreak of monkeypox virus is a public health concern in Nigeria. Media campaigns are planned to raise awareness about the disease; however, these campaigns have not demonstrated effectiveness in changing people's health behavior toward monkeypox. Media, health professionals, and government should synergize to promote a consistent health policy for the control and prevention of monkeypox virus.	1	Observational Study	Information Unavailable	10.1097/MD.0000000000017985	Wogu JO, Chukwu CO, Orekyeh ESS, Nwankiti CO, Okoye-Ugwu S.

31875271	Monkeypox Rash Severity and Animal Exposures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	Experimental studies have suggested a larger inoculum of monkeypox virus may be associated with increased rash severity; however, little data are available on the relationship between specific animal exposures and rash severity in endemic regions. Using cross-sectional data from an active surveillance program conducted between 2005 and 2007 in the Sankuru Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we explored the possible relationship between rash severity and exposures to rodents and non-human primates among confirmed MPX cases. Among the 223 PCR-confirmed MPX cases identified during active surveillance, the majority of cases (n = 149) presented with mild rash (5-100 lesions) and 33% had a more serious presentation (> 100 lesions). No association between exposure to rodents and rash severity was found in the multivariable analysis. Those that self-reported hunting NHP 3 weeks prior to onset of MPX symptoms had 2.78 times the odds of severe rash than those that did not report such exposure (95% CI: 1.18, 6.58). This study provides a preliminary step in understanding the association between animal exposure and rash severity and demonstrates correlation with exposure to NHPs and human MPX presentation. Additional research exploring the relationship between rash severity and NHPs is warranted.	1	Information Unavailable	Animal exposure; Monkeypox; Rash illness; Rash severity	10.1007/s10393-019-01459-7	Doshi RH, Alfonso VH, Morier D, Hoff NA, Sinai C, Mulembakani P, Kisalu N, Cheng A, Ashbaugh H, Gadoth A, Cowell B, Okitolonda EW, Muyembe-Tamfum JJ, Rimoin AW.

6304185	Human monkeypox	Human monkeypox, occurring in the tropical rainforest of west and central Africa, is regarded as the most important orthopoxvirus infection for epidemiological surveillance during the post-smallpox era. This disease, first recognized in Zaïre in 1970 resembles smallpox clinically but differs epidemiologically. Clinical features, their evolution and sequelae of monkeypox could be compared with discrete ordinary or modified type of smallpox. A case-fatality rate of 14% has been observed but some cases can be exceedingly mild or atypical and may easily remain undetected and unreported. Pronounced lymphadenopathy has been the only clinical feature found commonly in monkeypox but not in smallpox. Fifty-seven cases of human monkeypox have occurred since 1970, in the tropical rainforests in six west and central African countries, the majority of them (45) being reported from Zaïre. The disease appears to be more frequent in dry season. Children below ten years of age comprise 84% of the cases. Smallpox vaccination protects against monkeypox. Clusters of cases have been observed in certain areas within countries and within affected households. Human-to-human spread has possibly occurred seven times. No cases of possible tertiary spread were observed. The secondary attack rate among susceptible close household contacts was 10%, among all susceptible contacts 5%. This is much lower than that occurring with smallpox, which is between 25-40%. The limited avidity of monkeypox virus for human beings indicates that monkeypox is probably a zoonosis, although the animal reservoir(s) have not yet been identified. The low transmissibility, resulting in low frequency of disease in man indicates that monkeypox is not a public health problem. Human monkeypox has been a relatively newly recognized disease. Studies are in progress to identify the natural cycle of monkeypox virus and to define better its clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Special surveillance is maintained in endemic areas with the aim to provide assurance that in spite of waning immunity of the human population following cessation of the smallpox vaccination, the disease does not constitute a potential danger to man.	11	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Gromyko AI, Szczeniowski MV.

32202967	Knowledge of human monkeypox viral infection among general practitioners: a cross-sectional study in Indonesia	After the first, imported, laboratory-confirmed case of monkeypox in human was reported in Singapore on May 2019, countries in Asia started to strengthen disease surveillance systems. One challenge in preventing monkeypox is a lack of knowledge, particularly among healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of monkeypox among general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. The survey collected participants' knowledge on a 21-item scale and explanatory variables. A two-step logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the predictors of knowledge of monkeypox. A total of 432 GPs were included; 10.0% and 36.5% of them had a good knowledge using an 80% and 70% cutoff point for knowledge domain, respectively. No explanatory variables were associated with knowledge when using 80% cutoff point. Using the lower cutoff, there was lower knowledge among GPs who graduated from universities located in Sumatra or other islands versus Java (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.53; 95%CI: 0.28-0.97, p = 0.041) and among those were older than 30 years compared to younger GPs (aOR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.39-0.96, p = 0.033). GPs working in private clinics had less knowledge compared to GPs in community health centers (aOR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.31-0.99, p = 0.047). In conclusion, knowledge of monkeypox among GPs in Indonesia is relatively low in all groups. Increasing knowledge of monkeypox will be key to improving the capacity of GPs to respond to human monkeypox cases and to report into a disease surveillance system.	3	Information Unavailable	Indonesia; Monkeypox; general practitioner; healthcare provider; knowledge; online survey	10.1080/20477724.2020.1743037	Harapan H, Setiawan AM, Yufika A, Anwar S, Wahyuni S, Asrizal FW, Sufri MR, Putra RP, Wijayanti NP, Salwiyadi S, Maulana R, Khusna A, Nusrina I, Shidiq M, Fitriani D, Muharrir M, Husna CA, Yusri F, Maulana R, Andalas M, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M.

30634001	Monkeypox virus phylogenetic similarities between a human case detected in Cameroon in 2018 and the 2017-2018 outbreak in Nigeria	A monkeypox virus was detected from a human clinical case in 2018 in Cameroon; a country where no human cases were reported since 1989. The virus exhibited close genetic relatedness with another monkeypox virus isolated in Nigeria during the 2017-2018 outbreak. Although our molecular findings argue in favor of an extension of the monkeypox outbreak from Nigeria into Cameroon, the possibility that the monkeypox virus detected could be indigenous to Cameroon cannot be ruled out.	3	Information Unavailable	Cameroon; Monkeypox virus; Phylogenetic relationships; West African clade	10.1016/j.meegid.2019.01.006	Sadeuh-Mba SA, Yonga MG, Els M, Batejat C, Eyangoh S, Caro V, Etoundi A, Carniel E, Njouom R.

6249508	Human monkeypox, 1970-79	Increasing attention has been given to human monkeypox since the achievement of global smallpox eradication. Monkeypox, which was first described in Central Africa in 1970, resembles smallpox clinically but differs from it epidemiologically. Forty-seven cases of human monkeypox have occurred since 1970 in 5 Central and West African countries; 38 of these cases have been reported from Zaire. The evolution of the illness and the sequelae of monkeypox and smallpox are the same; monkeypox has a case-fatality rate of about 17%. Children below 10 years of age comprise 83% of the cases. All cases have occurred in tropical rainforest areas and clustering of cases has been observed in certain zones within countries and within families. Person-to-person spread may have occurred in 4 cases; the secondary attack rate among susceptible, very close family members was 7.5% (3 cases/40 contacts) and among all susceptible contacts was 3.3% (4 cases/123 contacts)-much lower than the 25-40% secondary attack rate that occurs with smallpox. Although the low transmission rate and the low frequency of disease indicate that monkeypox is not a public health problem, more data are needed.Whilst many animals near human monkeypox cases have been demonstrated to have orthopoxvirus antibodies, the natural reservoir(s) and the vector(s) of monkeypox virus are unknown. Studies are in progress to identify the natural cycle of monkeypox virus and to define better the clinical and epidemiological features of this disease.	55	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Breman JG, Kalisa-Ruti, Steniowski MV, Zanotto E, Gromyko AI, Arita I.

32874456	An adult patient with suspected of monkeypox infection differential diagnosed to chickenpox	Background: Monkeypox is a zoonosis. The disease has a similar appearance to chickenpox caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). On May 9th 2019, there was one laboratory-confirmed case of monkeypox reported in Singapore. A man was also suspected of having monkeypox on June 1st 2019 in Surabaya, Indonesia, a neighboring country. Objective: To report on a suspected case of monkeypox with differential diagnosis to chickenpox. Case: A 51-year-old male was suspected of having monkeypox after a differential diagnosis of chickenpox. His chief complaint was multiple blisters on his body. From the dermatological status on his facial, trunk and extremity regions, there were multiple pleiomorphic vesicles, some with umbilication, with a centripetal distribution, and crusts. Methods and results: A PCR using VZV specific primers, followed by genome sequencing showed homologies of more than 99 % to other VZVs and less than 50% to Monkeypox sequences. Conclusion: Molecular laboratory techniques have confirmed the case as chickenpox.

4340216	Human monkeypox	Between October 1970 and May 1971, six cases of human infection with monkeypox virus were identified in Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Four of the cases were confirmed by virus isolation and two were diagnosed on the basis of epidemiological and serological investigations. All the cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals.Post-infection serological studies showed high haemagglutination-inhibition and neutralizing titres to pox group virus in four of the cases. Repeated challenge vaccination of all cases with potent smallpox vaccine resulted in equivocal reactions.In all, 24 susceptible household contacts were exposed to the infected cases, but none developed disease. All the contacts subsequently responded to vaccination with a primary reaction, thus confirming their susceptibility and ruling out asymptomatic infection.	24	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Foster SO, Brink EW, Hutchins DL, Pifer JM, Lourie B, Moser CR, Cummings EC, Kuteyi OE, Eke RE, Titus JB, Smith EA, Hicks JW, Foege WH.

16288402	Reemergence of monkeypox: prevalence, diagnostics, and countermeasures	Human monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease that occurs mostly in the rain forests of central and western Africa. However, the disease recently emerged in the United States in imported wild rodents from Africa. Monkeypox has a clinical presentation very similar to that of ordinary forms of smallpox, including flulike symptoms, fever, malaise, back pain, headache, and characteristic rash. Given this clinical spectrum, differential diagnosis to rule out smallpox is very important. There are no licensed therapies for human monkeypox; however, the smallpox vaccine can protect against the disease. The discontinuation of general vaccination in the 1980s has given rise to increasing susceptibility to monkeypox virus infection in the human population. This has led to fears that monkeypox virus could be used as a bioterrorism agent. Effective prevention relies on limiting the contact with infected patients or animals and limiting the respiratory exposure to infected patients.	40	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1086/498155	Nalca A, Rimoin AW, Bavari S, Whitehouse CA.

22709519	Factors affecting the likelihood of monkeypox&#x27;s emergence and spread in the post-smallpox era	In 1980, the World Health Assembly announced that smallpox had been successfully eradicated as a disease of humans. The disease clinically and immunologically most similar to smallpox is monkeypox, a zoonosis endemic to moist forested regions in West and Central Africa. Smallpox vaccine provided protection against both infections. Monkeypox virus is a less efficient human pathogen than the agent of smallpox, but absent smallpox and the population-wide immunity engendered during eradication efforts, could monkeypox now gain a foothold in human communities? We discuss possible ecologic and epidemiologic limitations that could impede monkeypox's emergence as a significant pathogen of humans, and evaluate whether genetic constrains are sufficient to diminish monkeypox virus' capacity for enhanced specificity as a parasite of humans.	25	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.coviro.2012.02.004	Reynolds MG, Carroll DS, Karem KL.

22884034	Comparative pathology of smallpox and monkeypox in man and macaques	In the three decades since the eradication of smallpox and cessation of routine vaccination, the collective memory of the devastating epidemics caused by this orthopoxvirus has waned, and the human population has become increasingly susceptible to a disease that remains high on the list of possible bioterrorism agents. Research using surrogate orthopoxviruses in their natural hosts, as well as limited variola virus research in animal models, continues worldwide; however, interpretation of findings is often limited by our relative lack of knowledge about the naturally occurring disease. For modern comparative pathologists, many of whom have no first-hand knowledge of naturally occurring smallpox, this work provides a contemporary review of this historical disease, as well as discussion of how it compares with human monkeypox and the corresponding diseases in macaques.	15	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jcpa.2012.06.007	Cann JA, Jahrling PB, Hensley LE, Wahl-Jensen V.

22239910	Outbreaks of human monkeypox after cessation of smallpox vaccination	The recent observation of a surge in human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) prompts the question of whether cessation of smallpox vaccination is driving the phenomenon, and if so, why is re-emergence not universal throughout the historic geographic range of the virus? Research addressing the virus's mechanisms for immune evasion and induction, as well as that directed at elucidating the genes involved in pathogenesis in different viral lineages (West African vs Congo Basin), provide insights to help explain why emergence appears to be geographically limited. Novel vaccines offer one solution to curtail the spread of this disease.	42	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.tim.2011.12.001	Reynolds MG, Damon IK.

32607280	A game-theoretic model of Monkeypox to assess vaccination strategies	Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic disease similar to smallpox. Its fatality rate is about 11% and it is endemic to the Central and West African countries. In this paper, we analyze a compartmental model of MPX dynamics. Our goal is to see whether MPX can be controlled and eradicated by voluntary vaccinations. We show that there are three equilibria-disease free, fully endemic and previously neglected semi-endemic (with disease existing only among humans). The existence of semi-endemic equilibrium has severe implications should the MPX virus mutate to increased viral fitness in humans. We find that MPX is controllable and can be eradicated in a semi-endemic equilibrium by vaccination. However, in a fully endemic equilibrium, MPX cannot be eradicated by vaccination alone.	6	Information Unavailable	Game theory; Monkeypox; Nash equilibrium; Smallpox; Vaccination	10.7717/peerj.9272	Bankuru SV, Kossol S, Hou W, Mahmoudi P, Rychtář J, Taylor D.

15494953	Monkeypox: a review of the history and emergence in the Western hemisphere	A mysterious disease was reported on May 24, 2003, when the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (DPH) received notice of a 3-year-old girl who had been hospitalized in central Wisconsin with cellulites and fever after being bitten by a prairie dog on May 13. The laboratory isolated a gram-negative bacillus, raising concerns that it might be tularemia or plague; ultimately, it was identified as an acinetobacter species and was considered to be a contaminant. Because no other such cases were reported at the time, the case was thought to be merely an isolated event. However, within two weeks, on June 2, 2003, evidence of a much wider scenario began to emerge. On that date, the Wisconsin DPH received notice from the Marshfield Laboratory that the mother of the first patient had become ill on May 26 and that electron-microscopic evidence of a poxvirus was found in a skin lesion. On that same day, another report, this time from the Milwaukee Health Department, of a strange illness was received at the DPH and described the case of a meat inspector who resided in southeastern Wisconsin and also was a distributor of exotic animals. By July 30, 2003, 72 confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox had been reported in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana and represented a large outbreak. The peak in the onset of illness occurred between May 29 and June 9, 2003, and no further cases of illness have been reported in humans since June 22, 2003. Traceback investigations from the child and other patients followed the route of introduction of monkeypox into Wisconsin to a distributor in Illinois, who had received a shipment of exotic animals imported into the United States through Texas from Ghana, West Africa.	7	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1053/j.spid.2004.09.001	Ligon BL.

29543790	Emergence of Monkeypox - West and Central Africa, 1970-2017	The recent apparent increase in human monkeypox cases across a wide geographic area, the potential for further spread, and the lack of reliable surveillance have raised the level of concern for this emerging zoonosis. In November 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with CDC, hosted an informal consultation on monkeypox with researchers, global health partners, ministries of health, and orthopoxvirus experts to review and discuss human monkeypox in African countries where cases have been recently detected and also identify components of surveillance and response that need improvement. Endemic human monkeypox has been reported from more countries in the past decade than during the previous 40 years. Since 2016, confirmed cases of monkeypox have occurred in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone and in captive chimpanzees in Cameroon. Many countries with endemic monkeypox lack recent experience and specific knowledge about the disease to detect cases, treat patients, and prevent further spread of the virus. Specific improvements in surveillance capacity, laboratory diagnostics, and infection control measures are needed to launch an efficient response. Further, gaps in knowledge about the epidemiology and ecology of the virus need to be addressed to design, recommend, and implement needed prevention and control measures.	47	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.15585/mmwr.mm6710a5	Durski KN, McCollum AM, Nakazawa Y, Petersen BW, Reynolds MG, Briand S, Djingarey MH, Olson V, Damon IK, Khalakdina A.

29231870	Improving the Care and Treatment of Monkeypox Patients in Low-Resource Settings: Applying Evidence from Contemporary Biomedical and Smallpox Biodefense Research	Monkeypox is a smallpox-like illness that can be accompanied by a range of significant medical complications. To date there are no standard or optimized guidelines for the clinical management of monkeypox (MPX) patients, particularly in low-resource settings. Consequently, patients can experience protracted illness and poor outcomes. Improving care necessitates developing a better understanding of the range of clinical manifestations-including complications and sequelae-as well as of features of illness that may be predictive of illness severity and poor outcomes. Experimental and natural infection of non-human primates with monkeypox virus can inform the approach to improving patient care, and may suggest options for pharmaceutical intervention. These studies have traditionally been performed to address the threat of smallpox bioterrorism and were designed with the intent of using MPX as a disease surrogate for smallpox. In many cases this necessitated employing high-dose, inhalational or intravenous challenge to recapitulate the severe manifestations of illness seen with smallpox. Overall, these data-and data from biomedical research involving burns, superficial wounds, herpes, eczema vaccinatum, and so forth-suggest that MPX patients could benefit from clinical support to mitigate the consequences of compromised skin and mucosa. This should include prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial infections (and other complications), ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition, and protecting vulnerable anatomical locations such as the eyes and genitals. A standard of care that considers these factors should be developed and assessed in different settings, using clinical metrics specific for MPX alongside consideration of antiviral therapies.	5	Review	Orthopoxvirus; animal model; clinical syndrome; monkeypox; standard of care	10.3390/v9120380	Reynolds MG, McCollum AM, Nguete B, Shongo Lushima R, Petersen BW.

31410720	Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Monkeypox in Democratic Republic of Congo, 2000-2015	Monkeypox is a viral disease with a clinical presentation resembling that of smallpox. Although monkeypox is considered to be an important zoonotic viral disease, its epidemiology remains poorly understood, especially the spatial and temporal distribution of the disease. The present study examined weekly reports of monkeypox cases collected from 2000 to 2015 at the health zone scale in the Democratic Republic of Congo. SaTScan® was performed to identify spatial and temporal clusters of monkeypox cases. Significant primary spatial clusters were detected in the districts of Sankuru and Tshuapa. A centrifugal pattern was found, with significant primary spatial clusters extending over time from Sankuru and Tshuapa to several neighboring districts. Peaks of cases occurred from July to September for the 2000-2002 and 2003-2009 sub-periods and from January to March for the 2010-2015 sub-period. Despite the lack of additional data for confirmation, the increasing of monkeypox reported incidence was observed in the Democratic Republic of Congo during 2000-2015 period and this increase cannot be explain only by the improvements of surveillance systems. The detected spatial clusters were located in the dense rainforest of the Congo basin. The reasons for the excess incidence of monkeypox cases in the central region of the country are unknown, and the relative influence of ecological, environmental, and human factors on the mechanism of emergence of monkeypox has yet to be identified.	1	Information Unavailable	Democratic Republic of Congo; Emerging infectious disease; Monkeypox; SaTScan; Spatio-temporal clusters; Surveillance data	10.1007/s10393-019-01435-1	Mandja BM, Brembilla A, Handschumacher P, Bompangue D, Gonzalez JP, Muyembe JJ, Mauny F.

35655436	Attaching a stigma to the LGBTQI+ community should be avoided during the monkeypox epidemic	"An outbreak of monkeypox, a rare zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, is currently ongoing and has spread so far to more than 20 countries, mostly affecting Europe, the Americas, Australia, and Israel, with more than 400 confirmed cases ([https://bnonews.com/monkeypox/](https://bnonews.com/monkeypox/)), becoming the largest monkeypox epidemic outside of western and central Africa, where it is endemic in eleven countries [1]. In the UK, where the first monkeypox case was reported on May 7, 2022, in a traveler returning from Nigeria, the National ""Health Security Agency"" (UKHSA) has reported that ""a notable proportion of early cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men and so UKHSA is urging this community in particular to be alert"" ([https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-cases-confirmed-in-england-latest-updates](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-cases-confirmed-in-england-latest-updates)).

Whereas in Africa, monkeypox cases are generally transmitted from infected animals, and human-to-human transmission began to emerge after the 1996-1997 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), linked to the discontinuation of vaccination against smallpox and the waning of immunity, poor hygiene and crowded living quarters, in developed countries other potential routes have been postulated, such as respiratory droplets, direct contact with mucocutaneous lesions, or fomites.

Results: We report 1057 confirmed cases. The average annual incidence was 14.1 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, 13.3-15.0). The incidence was higher in male patients (incidence rate ratio comparing males to females, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.37), except among those 20-29 years old (0.70; .51-.95). Females aged 20-29 years also reported a high frequency of exposures (26.2%) to people with monkeypox-like symptoms.The highest incidence was among 10-19-year-old males, the cohort reporting the highest proportion of animal exposures (37.5%). The incidence was lower among those presumed to have received smallpox vaccination than among those presumed unvaccinated. No differences were observed by age group in lesion count or lesion severity score. Conclusions: Monkeypox incidence was twice that reported during 1980-1985, an increase possibly linked to declining immunity provided by smallpox vaccination. The high proportion of cases attributed to human exposures suggests changing exposure patterns. Cases were distributed across age and sex, suggesting frequent exposures that follow sociocultural norms.	1	Information Unavailable	Democratic Republic of the Congo; Monkeypox; Monkeypox virus; Orthopoxvirus; Surveillance	10.1093/infdis/jiab133	Whitehouse ER, Bonwitt J, Hughes CM, Lushima RS, Likafi T, Nguete B, Kabamba J, Monroe B, Doty JB, Nakazawa Y, Damon I, Malekani J, Davidson W, Wilkins K, Li Y, Radford KW, Schmid DS, Pukuta E, Muyamuna E, Karhemere S, Tamfum JM, Okitolonda EW, McCollum AM, Reynolds MG.

32194068	Confidence in managing human monkeypox cases in Asia: A cross-sectional survey among general practitioners in Indonesia	The current re-emergence of human monkeypox (HMPX) is a global concern for endemic and non-endemic countries, but healthcare workers in some regions, like Asia, have less experience with identifying and treating HMPX cases. This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs' confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p < 0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.	2	Information Unavailable	Confidence; General practitioner; Human monkeypox; Monkeypox; Perspective	10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450	Harapan H, Setiawan AM, Yufika A, Anwar S, Wahyuni S, Asrizal FW, Sufri MR, Putra RP, Wijayanti NP, Salwiyadi S, Maulana R, Khusna A, Nusrina I, Shidiq M, Fitriani D, Muharrir M, Husna CA, Yusri F, Maulana R, Utomo PS, Andalas M, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M.

31142401	Analgesia during Monkeypox Virus Experimental Challenge Studies in Prairie Dogs ( Cynomys ludovicianus)	Because human patients with monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection report painful symptoms, it is reasonable to assume that animals infected with MPXV experience some degree of pain. Understanding whether and how analgesics affect MPXV disease progression is crucial when planning in vivo challenge experiments. In the current study, we challenged prairie dogs with a low dose (4 ×10³ pfu) of MPXV and treated with meloxicam (NSAID) or buprenorphine (opioid); control animals did not receive analgesia or received analgesia without MPXV challenge. Subsets of animals from each group were serially euthanized during the course of the study. Disease progression and viral kinetics were similar between groups, but MXPVinfected, meloxicam-treated animals showed increasing trends of morbidity and mortality compared with other groups. Differences between no-analgesia MPXV-infected control animals and MPXV-infected animals treated with buprenorphine were minimal. The findings in the current study allow more informed decisions concerning the use of analgesics during experimental MPXV challenge studies, thereby improving animal welfare. In light of these findings, we have modified our pain scale for this animal model to include the use of buprenorphine for pain relief when warranted after MPXV challenge.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.30802/AALAS-JAALAS-18-000036	Hutson CL, Gallardo-Romero N, Carroll DS, Salzer JS, Ayers JD, Doty JB, Hughes CM, Nakazawa Y, Hudson P, Patel N, Keckler MS, Olson VA, Nagy T.

31769389	Asymptomatic Orthopoxvirus Circulation in Humans in the Wake of a Monkeypox Outbreak among Chimpanzees in Cameroon	Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. In Cameroon, human monkeypox cases were confirmed in 2018, and outbreaks in captive chimpanzees occurred in 2014 and 2016. We investigated the OPXV serological status among staff at a primate sanctuary (where the 2016 chimpanzee outbreak occurred) and residents from nearby villages, and describe contact with possible monkeypox reservoirs. We focused specifically on Gambian rats (Cricetomys spp.) because they are recognized possible reservoirs and because contact with Gambian rats was common enough to render sufficient statistical power. We collected one 5-mL whole blood specimen from each participant to perform a generic anti-OPXV ELISA test for IgG and IgM antibodies and administered a questionnaire about prior symptoms of monkeypox-like illness and contact with possible reservoirs. Our results showed evidence of OPXV exposures (IgG positive, 6.3%; IgM positive, 1.6%) among some of those too young to have received smallpox vaccination (born after 1980, n = 63). No participants reported prior symptoms consistent with monkeypox. After adjusting for education level, participants who frequently visited the forest were more likely to have recently eaten Gambian rats (OR: 3.36, 95% CI: 1.91-5.92, P < 0.001) and primate sanctuary staff were less likely to have touched or sold Gambian rats (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.19-0.28, P < 0.001). The asymptomatic or undetected circulation of OPXVs in humans in Cameroon is likely, and contact with monkeypox reservoirs is common, raising the need for continued surveillance for human and animal disease.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.19-0467	Guagliardo SAJ, Monroe B, Moundjoa C, Athanase A, Okpu G, Burgado J, Townsend MB, Satheshkumar PS, Epperson S, Doty JB, Reynolds MG, Dibongue E, Etoundi GA, Mathieu E, McCollum AM.

22693815	[Monkeypox: features of spread after cancellation of mandatory pox immunization]	Features of spread of monkeypox after eradication of smallpox and cancellation of mandatory pox immunization are examined. In the condition of cancellation of mandatory pox immunization, a decrease of population immunity to pox in the population, a lack of vigilance in most of the medical specialists to diseases caused by other pathogenic for human orthopoxviruses was noted. This situation complicates the prognosis of the development of possible outbreaks of infection of humans by monkeypox. In such situation only constant vigilance with respect to this zooanthroponosis, use of express diagnostics methods, as well as means of effective protection will allow to stop outbreaks of monkeypox at the early stages of the development.

31769405	Do Monkeypox Exposures Vary by Ethnicity? Comparison of Aka and Bantu Suspected Monkeypox Cases	In 2017, a monkeypox outbreak occurred in Likouala Department, Republic of the Congo. Many of the affected individuals were of Aka ethnicity, hunter-gatherers indigenous to Central Africa who have worse health outcomes in comparison with other forest-dwelling peoples. To test the hypothesis that Aka people have different risk factors for monkeypox, we analyzed questionnaire data for 39 suspected cases, comparing Aka and Bantu groups. Aka people were more likely to touch animal urine/feces, find dead animals in/around the home, eat an animal that was found dead, or to have been scratched or bitten by an animal (P < 0.05, all variables). They were also more likely to visit the forest ≥ once/week, sleep outside, or sleep on the ground (P < 0.001, all variables), providing opportunities for contact with monkeypox reservoirs during the night. The Aka and possibly other vulnerable groups may warrant special attention during educational and health promotion programs.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.19-0457	Guagliardo SAJ, Doshi RH, Reynolds MG, Dzabatou-Babeaux A, Ndakala N, Moses C, McCollum AM, Petersen BW.

17326932	Qualitative assessment of risk for monkeypox associated with domestic trade in certain animal species, United States	In 2003, US officials identified several human monkeypox cases and traced the virus exposure to infected captive prairie dogs. The virus was likely introduced through a shipment of imported African rodents, which were kept with other mammals, including prairie dogs, in a pet distribution facility in the Midwest. To prevent the further introduction and spread of the virus, federal agencies restricted the importation of African rodents and restricted the domestic trade or movement of prairie dogs and certain other rodents. In this qualitative assessment of the risk for monkeypox associated with the 2003 outbreak, we conclude that the probability of further human infection is low; the risk is further mitigated by rodent import restrictions. Were this zoonotic disease to become established domestically, the public health effects could be substantial.	6	Review	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1212.060454	Bernard SM, Anderson SA.

10326294	Re-emergence of monkeypox in Africa: a review of the past six years	Human monkeypox was first identified in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Extensive studies of this zoonotic infection in the 1970s and 1980s indicated a largely sporadic disease with a minority of cases resulting from person-to-person transmission, rarely beyond two generations. In August 1996, an unusually large outbreak of human monkeypox was reported, and cases continued through 1997 with peak incidence in August 1996, March 1997 and August 1997. Preliminary results from the field investigations in 1997 suggest a new epidemiological pattern where a majority of secondary cases result from person-to-person transmission, and a clinically milder disease. But there is preliminary laboratory evidence of a simultaneous outbreak of varicella in the same geographic region which will undoubtedly modify these preliminary results. Since smallpox was eradicated and vaccinia vaccination terminated in this region, the population of susceptible individuals has grown. The use of vaccination to protect the population at risk, however, must take into account HIV prevalence and the risk of generalized vaccinia when using vaccinia vaccine in populations where HIV is known to be present.	40	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011720	Heymann DL, Szczeniowski M, Esteves K.

15335444	Anticipating smallpox and monkeypox outbreaks: complications of the smallpox vaccine	Background: The recent outbreak in the Midwest of monkeypox, as well as the continued fears of a terrorist-induced epidemic of smallpox, prompted the authors' review of the literature regarding past and current experiences with smallpox vaccination. The smallpox vaccine, which is highly effective in preventing the spread of both these orthopoxvirus infectious illnesses, might be administered to numerous health care workers and, in the event of a smallpox attack, millions of other citizens. However, vaccinees would be at risk for several vaccine-related neurologic complications. Review summary: According to prior reports, neurologic complications have occurred in 2.5 per million US individuals, with the most common being postvaccinal encephalomyelitis (PVEM). In older children and adults, PVEM causes stupor and coma, seizures, paraparesis, and other neurologic and mental abnormalities, and, in 16% of cases, permanent neurologic sequelae. The overall mortality rate of neurologic complications is approximately 1.5 per million vaccinees. Risk factors for PVEM were age younger than 1 year and no previous smallpox vaccination, but not a prior episode of PVEM or other preexisting neurologic illnesses. Neither the current smallpox vaccination campaigns in Israel nor the one in the United States has had comparable complications, but the US campaign has been associated with myocarditis and myopericarditis. Conclusion: Although the potential neurologic complications of the smallpox vaccine must be weighed against the threat of monkeypox and smallpox, current experience with vaccination suggests it carries a very low risk of neurologic complications and does not lead to exacerbations of chronic neurologic illnesses.	3	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1097/01.nrl.0000138998.11209.88	Abrahams BC, Kaufman DM.

30666937	Epidemiologic and Ecologic Investigations of Monkeypox, Likouala Department, Republic of the Congo, 2017	Monkeypox, caused by a zoonotic orthopoxvirus, is endemic in Central and West Africa. Monkeypox has been sporadically reported in the Republic of the Congo. During March 22-April 5, 2017, we investigated 43 suspected human monkeypox cases. We interviewed suspected case-patients and collected dried blood strips and vesicular and crust specimens (active lesions), which we tested for orthopoxvirus antibodies by ELISA and monkeypox virus and varicella zoster virus DNA by PCR. An ecologic investigation was conducted around Manfouété, and specimens from 105 small mammals were tested for anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies or DNA. Among the suspected human cases, 22 met the confirmed, probable, and possible case definitions. Only 18 patients had available dried blood strips; 100% were IgG positive, and 88.9% (16/18) were IgM positive. Among animals, only specimens from Cricetomys giant pouched rats showed presence of orthopoxvirus antibodies, adding evidence to this species' involvement in the transmission and maintenance of monkeypox virus in nature.	6	Information Unavailable	Republic of the Congo; ecology; epidemiology; monkeypox; orthopoxvirus; viruses; zoonoses	10.3201/eid2502.181222	Doshi RH, Guagliardo SAJ, Doty JB, Babeaux AD, Matheny A, Burgado J, Townsend MB, Morgan CN, Satheshkumar PS, Ndakala N, Kanjingankolo T, Kitembo L, Malekani J, Kalemba L, Pukuta E, N'kaya T, Kangoula F, Moses C, McCollum AM, Reynolds MG, Mombouli JV, Nakazawa Y, Petersen BW.

15051569	The role of the obstetrician-gynecologist in emerging infectious diseases: monkeypox and pregnancy	Early in June 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced yet another unique infectious disease outbreak, the first evidence of community-acquired monkeypox in the United States. By July 8, 2003, a total of 71 cases had been reported to CDC from 6 states. When emerging infectious diseases are reported in the United States, particularly when these reports receive widespread media attention, obstetrician-gynecologists may be called upon to rapidly respond to queries from their patients and to address certain infectious disease risks within their clinical practices. In addition, obstetrician-gynecologists may have specific concerns about the implications for an infectious disease outbreak, such as monkeypox, for pregnant women. Therefore, it is important that obstetrician-gynecologists know how to gather up-to-date and accurate information about infectious disease outbreaks and that they be familiar with the public health response system for responding to such outbreaks.	5	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1097/01.AOG.0000114987.76424.6d	Jamieson DJ, Cono J, Richards CL, Treadwell TA.

34158533	Genomic history of human monkey pox infections in the Central African Republic between 2001 and 2018	Monkeypox is an emerging infectious disease, which has a clinical presentation similar to smallpox. In the two past decades, Central Africa has seen an increase in the frequency of cases, with many monkeypox virus (MPXV) isolates detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR). To date, no complete MPXV viral genome has been published from the human cases identified in the CAR. The objective of this study was to sequence the full genome of 10 MPXV isolates collected during the CAR epidemics between 2001 and 2018 in order to determine their phylogenetic relationships among MPXV lineages previously described in Central Africa and West Africa. Our phylogenetic results indicate that the 10 CAR isolates belong to three lineages closely related to those found in DRC. The phylogenetic pattern shows that all of them emerged in the rainforest block of the Congo Basin. Since most human index cases in CAR occurred at the northern edge of western and eastern rainforests, transmissions from wild animals living in the rainforest is the most probable hypothesis. In addition, molecular dating estimates suggest that periods of intense political instability resulting in population movements within the country often associated also with increased poverty may have led to more frequent contact with host wild animals. The CAR socio-economic situation, armed conflicts and ecological disturbances will likely incite populations to interact more and more with wild animals and thus increase the risk of zoonotic spillover.

24040344	Mapping monkeypox transmission risk through time and space in the Congo Basin	Monkeypox is a major public health concern in the Congo Basin area, with changing patterns of human case occurrences reported in recent years. Whether this trend results from better surveillance and detection methods, reduced proportions of vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated human populations, or changing environmental conditions remains unclear. Our objective is to examine potential correlations between environment and transmission of monkeypox events in the Congo Basin. We created ecological niche models based on human cases reported in the Congo Basin by the World Health Organization at the end of the smallpox eradication campaign, in relation to remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index datasets from the same time period. These models predicted independent spatial subsets of monkeypox occurrences with high confidence; models were then projected onto parallel environmental datasets for the 2000s to create present-day monkeypox suitability maps. Recent trends in human monkeypox infection are associated with broad environmental changes across the Congo Basin. Our results demonstrate that ecological niche models provide useful tools for identification of areas suitable for transmission, even for poorly-known diseases like monkeypox.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0074816	Nakazawa Y, Lash RR, Carroll DS, Damon IK, Karem KL, Reynolds MG, Osorio JE, Rocke TE, Malekani JM, Muyembe JJ, Formenty P, Peterson AT.

31126795	Recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of Monkeypox virus	In this study, a rapid method for the detection of Central and West Africa clades of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay targeting the G2R gene was developed. MPXV, an Orthopoxvirus, is a zoonotic dsDNA virus, which is listed as a biothreat agent. RPA was operated at a single constant temperature of 42°C and produced results within 3 to 10 minutes. The MPXV-RPA-assay was highly sensitive with a limit of detection of 16 DNA molecules/μl. The clinical performance of the MPXV-RPA-assay was tested using 47 sera and whole blood samples from humans collected during the recent MPXV outbreak in Nigeria as well as 48 plasma samples from monkeys some of which were experimentally infected with MPXV. The specificity of the MPXV-RPA-assay was 100% (50/50), while the sensitivity was 95% (43/45). This new MPXV-RPA-assay is fast and can be easily utilised at low resource settings using a solar powered mobile suitcase laboratory.	3	Information Unavailable	Monkeypox Virus; Recombinase polymerase amplification assay; mobile suitcase; point of need; rapid detection system	10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2019.03.015	Davi SD, Kissenkötter J, Faye M, Böhlken-Fascher S, Stahl-Hennig C, Faye O, Faye O, Sall AA, Weidmann M, Ademowo OG, Hufert FT, Czerny CP, Abd El Wahed A.

33536322	Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of a Potential Smallpox Therapeutic, Brincidofovir, in a Lethal Monkeypox Virus Animal Model	Smallpox, caused by Variola virus (VARV), was eradicated in 1980; however, VARV bioterrorist threats still exist, necessitating readily available therapeutics. Current preparedness activities recognize the importance of oral antivirals and recommend therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is closely related to VARV, causing a highly similar clinical human disease, and can be used as a surrogate for smallpox antiviral testing. The prairie dog MPXV model has been characterized and used to study the efficacy of antipoxvirus therapeutics, including recently approved TPOXX (tecovirimat). Brincidofovir (BCV; CMX001) has shown antiviral activity against double-stranded DNA viruses, including poxviruses. To determine the exposure of BCV following oral administration to prairie dogs, a pharmacokinetics (PK) study was performed. Analysis of BCV plasma concentrations indicated variability, conceivably due to the outbred nature of the animals. To determine BCV efficacy in the MPXV prairie dog model, groups of animals were intranasally challenged with 9 × 105 plaque-forming units (PFU; 90% lethal dose [LD90]) of MPXV on inoculation day 0 (ID0). Animals were divided into groups based on the first day of BCV treatment relative to inoculation day (ID-1, ID0, or ID1). A trend in efficacy was noted dependent upon treatment initiation (57% on ID-1, 43% on ID0, and 29% on ID1) but was lower than demonstrated in other animal models. Analysis of the PK data indicated that BCV plasma exposure (maximum concentration [C max]) and the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) were lower than in other animal models administered the same doses, indicating that suboptimal BCV exposure may explain the lower protective effect on survival.IMPORTANCE Preparedness activities against highly transmissible viruses with high mortality rates have been highlighted during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Smallpox, caused by variola virus (VARV) infection, is highly transmissible, with an estimated 30% mortality. Through an intensive vaccination campaign, smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and routine smallpox vaccination of individuals ceased. Today's current population has little/no immunity against VARV. If smallpox were to reemerge, the worldwide results would be devastating. Recent FDA approval of one smallpox antiviral (tecovirimat) was a successful step in biothreat preparedness; however, orthopoxviruses can become resistant to treatment, suggesting the need for multiple therapeutics. Our paper details the efficacy of the investigational smallpox drug brincidofovir in a monkeypox virus (MPXV) animal model. Since brincidofovir has not been tested in vivo against smallpox, studies with the related virus MPXV are critical in understanding whether it would be protective in the event of a smallpox outbreak.	1	Information Unavailable	animal models; experimental therapeutics; monkeypox; smallpox; virology	10.1128/mSphere.00927-20	Hutson CL, Kondas AV, Mauldin MR, Doty JB, Grossi IM, Morgan CN, Ostergaard SD, Hughes CM, Nakazawa Y, Kling C, Martin BE, Ellison JA, Carroll DS, Gallardo-Romero NF, Olson VA.	mSphere. 2021 Feb 3;6(1):e00927-20. doi: 10.1128/mSphere.00927-20.
16085032	Emerging infections and pregnancy: West Nile virus, monkeypox, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and bioterrorism	As new infectious diseases, such as West Nile virus, monkeypox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are recognized in the United States, there are critical questions about how these infectious diseases will affect pregnant women and their infants. In addition, the implications of bioterrorist attacks for exposed pregnant women need to be considered. In this article, the authors address the following questions for a number of infectious disease threats: (1) does pregnancy affect the clinical course of these novel infectious diseases?, (2) what are the implications for prophylaxis and treatment of exposed or infected pregnant women?, and (3) are these novel infectious diseases transmitted during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding?	5	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.clp.2005.04.008	Jamieson DJ, Jernigan DB, Ellis JE, Treadwell TA.

32328334	A Case Report of Monkeypox in a 4-Year-Old Boy from the DR Congo: Challenges of Diagnosis and Management	Monkeypox (MP) is a rare zoonotic disease that most commonly transmits from bush animals to humans in the Congo Basin of Africa. However, an increase in cases of MP has been observed over the past decades with frequent outbreaks as well as export of the disease out of the African continent. MP belongs to the same genus of viruses as smallpox, the Orthopoxvirus, and vaccination against smallpox gives some protection against MP. With the eradication of smallpox in 1980, vaccination against smallpox has ceased. The resulting decrease of immunity against Orthopoxvirus is thought to be related to the increase in MP cases. Furthermore, closer contact between humans and bush animals could play a role along with the ongoing difficulties of controlling HIV in the same geographical area. MP remains a diagnostic challenge. Lack of knowledge about the disease among health personnel plays an important role, as well as access to diagnostic tools is limited. Treatment of MP is for now symptomatic. We report the case of a 4-year-old boy from the DR Congo with the clinical diagnosis of MP. This case illustrates some of the abovementioned challenges related to the management of MP in the field.	1	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1155/2020/8572596	Eltvedt AK, Christiansen M, Poulsen A.

34285423	Misinformation making a disease outbreak worse: outcomes compared for influenza, monkeypox, and norovirus	"Health misinformation can exacerbate infectious disease outbreaks. Especially pernicious advice could be classified as ""fake news"": manufactured with no respect for accuracy and often integrated with emotive or conspiracy-framed narratives. We built an agent-based model that simulated separate but linked circulating contagious disease and sharing of health advice (classified as useful or harmful). Such advice has potential to influence human risk-taking behavior and therefore the risk of acquiring infection, especially as people are more likely in observed social networks to share bad advice. We test strategies proposed in the recent literature for countering misinformation. Reducing harmful advice from 50% to 40% of circulating information, or making at least 20% of the population unable to share or believe harmful advice, mitigated the influence of bad advice in the disease outbreak outcomes. How feasible it is to try to make people ""immune"" to misinformation or control spread of harmful advice should be explored."	8	Information Unavailable	Agent-based models; fake news; influenza; monkeypox; norovirus; social networks	10.1177/0037549719885021	Brainard J, Hunter PR.

31557167	Characterization of Monkeypox virus dissemination in the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) through in vivo bioluminescent imaging	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus, endemic in Central and West Africa. This viral zoonosis was introduced into the United States in 2003 via African rodents imported for the pet trade and caused 37 human cases, all linked to exposure to MPXV-infected black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs have since become a useful model of MPXV disease, utilized for testing of potential medical countermeasures. In this study, we used recombinant MPXV containing the firefly luciferase gene (luc) and in vivo imaging technology to characterize MPXV pathogenesis in the black-tailed prairie dog in real time. West African (WA) MPXV could be visualized using in vivo imaging in the nose, lymph nodes, intestines, heart, lung, kidneys, and liver as early as day 6 post infection (p.i.). By day 9 p.i., lesions became visible on the skin and in some cases in the spleen. After day 9 p.i., luminescent signal representing MPXV replication either increased, indicating a progression to what would be a fatal infection, or decreased as infection was resolved. Use of recombinant luc+ MPXV allowed for a greater understanding of how MPXV disseminates throughout the body in prairie dogs during the course of infection. This technology will be used to reduce the number of animals required in future pathogenesis studies as well as aid in determining the effectiveness of potential medical countermeasures.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0222612	Weiner ZP, Salzer JS, LeMasters E, Ellison JA, Kondas AV, Morgan CN, Doty JB, Martin BE, Satheshkumar PS, Olson VA, Hutson CL.

27994107	Evaluation of the GeneXpert for Human Monkeypox Diagnosis	Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a zoonotic orthopoxvirus (OPX), is endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Currently, diagnostic assays for human monkeypox (MPX) focus on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, which are typically performed in sophisticated laboratory settings. Herein, we evaluated the accuracy and utility of a multiplex MPX assay using the GeneXpert platform, a portable rapid diagnostic device that may serve as a point-of-care test to diagnose infections in endemic areas. The multiplex MPX/OPX assay includes a MPX-specific PCR test, OPX-generic PCR test, and an internal control PCR test. In total, 164 diagnostic specimens (50 crusts and 114 vesicular swabs) were collected from suspected MPX cases in Tshuapa Province, DRC, under national surveillance guidelines. The specimens were tested with the GeneXpert MPX/OPX assay and an OPX PCR assay at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. Aliquots of each specimen were tested in parallel with a MPX-specific PCR assay at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results of the MPX PCR were used as the gold standard for all analyses. The GeneXpert MPX/OPX assay performed at INRB had a sensitivity of 98.8% and specificity of 100%. The GeneXpert assay performed well with both crust and vesicle samples. The GeneXpert MPX/OPX test incorporates a simple methodology that performs well in both laboratory and field conditions, suggesting its viability as a diagnostic platform that may expand and expedite current MPX detection capabilities.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.16-0567	Li D, Wilkins K, McCollum AM, Osadebe L, Kabamba J, Nguete B, Likafi T, Balilo MP, Lushima RS, Malekani J, Damon IK, Vickery MCL, Pukuta E, Nkawa F, Karhemere S, Tamfum JM, Okitolonda EW, Li Y, Reynolds MG.

25912718	A phylogeographic investigation of African monkeypox	Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by a virus member of the genus Orthopoxvirus and is endemic to Central and Western African countries. Previous work has identified two geographically disjuct clades of monkeypox virus based on the analysis of a few genomes coupled with epidemiological and clinical analyses; however, environmental and geographic causes of this differentiation have not been explored. Here, we expand previous phylogenetic studies by analyzing a larger set of monkeypox virus genomes originating throughout Sub-Saharan Africa to identify possible biogeographic barriers associated with genetic differentiation; and projected ecological niche models onto environmental conditions at three periods in the past to explore the potential role of climate oscillations in the evolution of the two primary clades. Analyses supported the separation of the Congo Basin and West Africa clades; the Congo Basin clade shows much shorter branches, which likely indicate a more recent diversification of isolates within this clade. The area between the Sanaga and Cross Rivers divides the two clades and the Dahomey Gap seems to have also served as a barrier within the West African clade. Contraction of areas with suitable environments for monkeypox virus during the Last Glacial Maximum, suggests that the Congo Basin clade of monkeypox virus experienced a severe bottleneck and has since expanded its geographic range.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3390/v7042168	Nakazawa Y, Mauldin MR, Emerson GL, Reynolds MG, Lash RR, Gao J, Zhao H, Li Y, Muyembe JJ, Kingebeni PM, Wemakoy O, Malekani J, Karem KL, Damon IK, Carroll DS.

2907258	Human monkeypox: confusion with chickenpox	"Human monkeypox is a zoonosis occurring sporadically in the tropical rain forest of western and central Africa. The exact incidence and geographical distribution are unknown, since many cases are not recognized. Special surveillance was established in three regions in Zaire in 1981 that led to a substantial increase in reported cases. The question arose as to the possibility that clinical diagnostic errors cause some cases of monkeypox to be misdiagnosed as other eruptive diseases. This paper presents the results of a study assessing the extent of and reasons for these clinical diagnostic errors in areas where health staff as well as the general public are aware of human monkeypox. In Zaire in the period 1981-1986, 977 persons with skin eruption not clinically diagnosed as human monkeypox were laboratory tested. 3.3% of human monkeypox cases were found among 730 patients diagnosed as cases of chickenpox, 7.3% among cases diagnosed as ""atypical chickenpox"" and 6.1% among cases with skin rash for which clinical diagnosis could not be established. The diagnostic difficulties were mainly based on clinical features characteristic of chickenpox: regional pleomorphism (in 46% of misdiagnosed cases), indefinite body-distribution of skin eruptions (49%), and centripetal distribution of skin lesions (17%). Lymph-node enlargement was observed in 76% of misdiagnosed patients. In the absence of smallpox, the main clinical diagnostic problem is the differentiation of human monkeypox from chickenpox. The presence of lymphadenopathy, pre-eruptive fever and slower maturation of skin lesions are the most important clinical signs supporting correct diagnosis of monkeypox."	16	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Szczeniowski M, Paluku KM, Mutombo M, Grab B.

30995249	The 2017 human monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria-Report of outbreak experience and response in the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital, Bayelsa State, Nigeria	Background: In September 2017, Nigeria experienced a large outbreak of human monkeypox (HMPX). In this study, we report the outbreak experience and response in the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital (NDUTH), Bayelsa state, where the index case and majority of suspected cases were reported. Methods: In a cross-sectional study between September 25th and 31st December 2017, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all suspected and confirmed cases of HMPX seen at the NDUTH and appraised the plans, activities and challenges of the hospital in response to the outbreak based on documented observations of the hospital's infection control committee (IPC). Monkeypox cases were defined using the interim national guidelines as provided by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Results: Of 38 suspected cases of HMPX, 18(47.4%) were laboratory confirmed, 3(7.9%) were probable, while 17 (18.4%) did not fit the case definition for HMPX. Majority of the confirmed/probable cases were adults (80.9%) and males (80.9%). There was concomitant chicken pox, syphilis and HIV-1 infections in two confirmed cases and a case of nosocomial infection in one healthcare worker (HCW). The hospital established a make-shift isolation ward for case management, constituted a HMPX response team and provided IPC resources. At the outset, some HCWs were reluctant to participate in the outbreak and others avoided suspected patients. Some patients and their family members experienced stigma and discrimination and there were cases of refusal of isolation. Repeated trainings and collaborative efforts by all stakeholders addressed some of these challenges and eventually led to successful containment of the outbreak. Conclusion: While the 2017 outbreak of human monkeypox in Nigeria was contained, our report reveals gaps in outbreak response that could serve as lessons to other hospitals to strengthen epidemic preparedness and response activities in the hospital setting.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0214229	Ogoina D, Izibewule JH, Ogunleye A, Ederiane E, Anebonam U, Neni A, Oyeyemi A, Etebu EN, Ihekweazu C.

33289470	A Tale of Two Viruses: Coinfections of Monkeypox and Varicella Zoster Virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo	Recent enhanced monkeypox (MPX) surveillance in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where MPX is endemic, has uncovered multiple cases of MPX and varicella zoster virus (VZV) coinfections. The purpose of this study was to verify if coinfections occur and to characterize the clinical nature of these cases. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory results were used to investigate MPX/VZV coinfections. A coinfection was defined as a patient with at least one Orthopoxvirus/MPX-positive sample and at least one VZV-positive sample within the same disease event. Between September 2009 and April 2014, 134 of the 1,107 (12.1%) suspected MPX cases were confirmed as MPX/VZV coinfections. Coinfections were more likely to report symptoms than VZV-alone cases and less likely than MPX-alone cases. Significantly higher lesion counts were observed for coinfection cases than for VZV-alone but less than MPX-alone cases. Discernible differences in symptom and rash severity were detected for coinfection cases compared with those with MPX or VZV alone. Findings indicate infection with both MPX and VZV could modulate infection severity. Collection of multiple lesion samples allows for the opportunity to detect coinfections. As this program continues, it will be important to continue these procedures to assess variations in the proportion of coinfected cases over time.

27585810	Finishing monkeypox genomes from short reads: assembly analysis and a neural network method	"Background: Poxviruses constitute one of the largest and most complex animal virus families known. The notorious smallpox disease has been eradicated and the virus contained, but its simian sister, monkeypox is an emerging, untreatable infectious disease, killing 1 to 10 % of its human victims. In the case of poxviruses, the emergence of monkeypox outbreaks in humans and the need to monitor potential malicious release of smallpox virus requires development of methods for rapid virus identification. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is an emergent technology with increasing application to the diagnosis of diseases and the identification of outbreak pathogens. But ""finishing"" such a genome is a laborious and time-consuming process, not easily automated. To date the large, complete poxvirus genomes have not been studied comprehensively in terms of applying WGS techniques and evaluating genome assembly algorithms. Results: To explore the limitations to finishing a poxvirus genome from short reads, we first analyze the repetitive regions in a monkeypox genome and evaluate genome assembly on the simulated reads. We also report on procedures and insights relevant to the assembly (from realistically short reads) of genomes. Finally, we propose a neural network method (namely Neural-KSP) to ""finish"" the process by closing gaps remaining after conventional assembly, as the final stage in a protocol to elucidate clinical poxvirus genomic sequences. Conclusions: The protocol may prove useful in any clinical viral isolate (regardless if a reference-strain sequence is available) and especially useful in genomes confounded by many global and local repetitive sequences embedded in them. This work highlights the feasibility of finishing real, complex genomes by systematically analyzing genetic characteristics, thus remedying existing assembly shortcomings with a neural network method. Such finished sequences may enable clinicians to track genetic distance between viral isolates that provides a powerful epidemiological tool."	3	Information Unavailable	Gap filling; Graph; Neural Network; Poxvirus; Public health; Repetitive sequence; Whole-genome sequencing; de novo Assembly	10.1186/s12864-016-2826-8	Zhao K, Wohlhueter RM, Li Y.

32717786	Comparison of Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Imaging to Chromogenic Immunohistochemistry of Skin Biomarkers in Response to Monkeypox Virus Infection	Over the last 15 years, advances in immunofluorescence-imaging based cycling methods, antibody conjugation methods, and automated image processing have facilitated the development of a high-resolution, multiplexed tissue immunofluorescence (MxIF) method with single cell-level quantitation termed Cell DIVETM. Originally developed for fixed oncology samples, here it was evaluated in highly fixed (up to 30 days), archived monkeypox virus-induced inflammatory skin lesions from a retrospective study in 11 rhesus monkeys to determine whether MxIF was comparable to manual H-scoring of chromogenic stains. Six protein markers related to immune and cellular response (CD68, CD3, Hsp70, Hsp90, ERK1/2, ERK1/2 pT202_pY204) were manually quantified (H-scores) by a pathologist from chromogenic IHC double stains on serial sections and compared to MxIF automated single cell quantification of the same markers that were multiplexed on a single tissue section. Overall, there was directional consistency between the H-score and the MxIF results for all markers except phosphorylated ERK1/2 (ERK1/2 pT202_pY204), which showed a decrease in the lesion compared to the adjacent non-lesioned skin by MxIF vs an increase via H-score. Improvements to automated segmentation using machine learning and adding additional cell markers for cell viability are future options for improvement. This method could be useful in infectious disease research as it conserves tissue, provides marker colocalization data on thousands of cells, allowing further cell level data mining as well as a reduction in user bias.	2	Comparative Study	IHC; MPXV; MxIF; Orthopoxvirus; Poxviridae; immunohistochemistry; monkeypox; monkeypox virus; multiplexed immunofluorescence; poxvirus	10.3390/v12080787	Sood A, Sui Y, McDonough E, Santamaría-Pang A, Al-Kofahi Y, Pang Z, Jahrling PB, Kuhn JH, Ginty F.

23061051	Inhalational monkeypox virus infection in cynomolgus macaques	An inhalation exposure system was characterized to deliver aerosolized monkeypox virus (MPXV), and a non-human primate (NHP) inhalation monkeypox model was developed in cynomolgus macaques. A head-only aerosol exposure system was characterized, and two sampling methods were evaluated: liquid impingement via an impinger and impaction via a gelatin filter. The aerosol concentrations obtained with the gelatin filter and impinger were virtually identical, indicating that either method is acceptable for sampling aerosols containing MPXV. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) for individual aerosol tests in the aerosol system characterization and the NHP study ranged from 1.08 to 1.15 μm, indicating that the aerosol particles were of a sufficient size to reach the alveoli. Six cynomolgus macaques (four male and two female) were used on study. The animals were aerosol exposed with MPXV and received doses between 2.51 × 10(4) to 9.28 × 10(5) plaque forming units (PFUs) inhaled. Four of the six animals died or were euthanized due to their moribund conditions. Both animals that received the lowest exposure doses survived to the end of the observation period. The inhalation LD(50) was determined to be approximately 7.8 × 10(4) pfu inhaled. These data demonstrate that an inhalation MPXV infection model has been developed in the cynomolgus macaque with disease course and lethal dose similar to previously published data.	11	Information Unavailable	aerosol; exposure; inhalation; monkeypox	10.3389/fcimb.2012.00117	Barnewall RE, Fisher DA, Robertson AB, Vales PA, Knostman KA, Bigger JE.

28331092	Monkeypox Virus Host Factor Screen Using Haploid Cells Identifies Essential Role of GARP Complex in Extracellular Virus Formation	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a human pathogen that is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes Vaccinia virus and Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox). Human monkeypox is considered an emerging zoonotic infectious disease. To identify host factors required for MPXV infection, we performed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis screen in human haploid cells. The screen revealed several candidate genes, including those involved in Golgi trafficking, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis. We validated the role of a set of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes during infection, VPS51 to VPS54 (VPS51-54), which comprise the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. The GARP complex is a tethering complex involved in retrograde transport of endosomes to the trans-Golgi apparatus. Our data demonstrate that VPS52 and VPS54 were dispensable for mature virion (MV) production but were required for extracellular virus (EV) formation. For comparison, a known antiviral compound, ST-246, was used in our experiments, demonstrating that EV titers in VPS52 and VPS54 knockout (KO) cells were comparable to levels exhibited by ST-246-treated wild-type cells. Confocal microscopy was used to examine actin tail formation, one of the viral egress mechanisms for cell-to-cell dissemination, and revealed an absence of actin tails in VPS52KO- or VPS54KO-infected cells. Further evaluation of these cells by electron microscopy demonstrated a decrease in levels of wrapped viruses (WVs) compared to those seen with the wild-type control. Collectively, our data demonstrate the role of GARP complex genes in double-membrane wrapping of MVs necessary for EV formation, implicating the host endosomal trafficking pathway in orthopoxvirus infection.IMPORTANCE Human monkeypox is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV). Of the two MPXV clades, the Congo Basin strain is associated with severe disease, increased mortality, and increased human-to-human transmission relative to the West African strain. Monkeypox is endemic in regions of western and central Africa but was introduced into the United States in 2003 from the importation of infected animals. The threat of MPXV and other orthopoxviruses is increasing due to the absence of routine smallpox vaccination leading to a higher proportion of naive populations. In this study, we have identified and validated candidate genes that are required for MPXV infection, specifically, those associated with the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. Identifying host targets required for infection that prevents extracellular virus formation such as the GARP complex or the retrograde pathway can provide a potential target for antiviral therapy.	6	Information Unavailable	GARP complex; HAP1 screen; poxviruses; retrograde transport	10.1128/JVI.00011-17	Realegeno S, Puschnik AS, Kumar A, Goldsmith C, Burgado J, Sambhara S, Olson VA, Carroll D, Damon I, Hirata T, Kinoshita T, Carette JE, Satheshkumar PS.

17715329	Monkeypox-induced immunity and failure of childhood smallpox vaccination to provide complete protection	Following the U.S. monkeypox outbreak of 2003, blood specimens and clinical and epidemiologic data were collected from cases, defined by standard definition, and household contacts of cases to evaluate the role of preexisting (smallpox vaccine-derived) and acquired immunity in susceptibility to monkeypox disease and clinical outcomes. Orthopoxvirus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, CD4, CD8, and B-cell responses were measured at approximately 7 to 14 weeks and 1 year postexposure. Associations between immune responses, smallpox vaccination, and epidemiologic and clinical data were assessed. Participants were categorized into four groups: (i) vaccinated cases, (ii) unvaccinated cases, (iii) vaccinated contacts, and (iv) unvaccinated contacts. Cases, regardless of vaccination status, were positive for orthopoxvirus-specific IgM, IgG, CD4, CD8, and B-cell responses. Antiorthopoxvirus immune responses consistent with infection were observed in some contacts who did not develop monkeypox. Vaccinated contacts maintained low levels of antiorthopoxvirus IgG, CD4, and B-cell responses, with most lacking IgM or CD8 responses. Preexisting immunity, assessed by high antiorthopoxvirus IgG levels and childhood smallpox vaccination, was associated (in a nonsignificant manner) with mild disease. Vaccination failed to provide complete protection against human monkeypox. Previously vaccinated monkeypox cases manifested antiorthopoxvirus IgM and changes in antiorthopoxvirus IgG, CD4, CD8, or B-cell responses as markers of recent infection. Antiorthopoxvirus IgM and CD8 responses occurred most frequently in monkeypox cases (vaccinated and unvaccinated), with IgG, CD4, and memory B-cell responses indicative of vaccine-derived immunity. Immune markers provided evidence of asymptomatic infections in some vaccinated, as well as unvaccinated, individuals.	25	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/CVI.00148-07	Karem KL, Reynolds M, Hughes C, Braden Z, Nigam P, Crotty S, Glidewell J, Ahmed R, Amara R, Damon IK.

32861468	Acceptance and willingness to pay for a hypothetical vaccine against monkeypox viral infection among frontline physicians: A cross-sectional study in Indonesia	Background: A clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a monkeypox vaccine among healthcare workers (HCWs). The critical question that needs to be addressed is whether HCWs are willing to accept and purchase this vaccine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine among HCWs. Methods: From May to July 2019, a cross-sectional study was conducted among registered general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia. A contingent valuation method was employed to evaluate the WTP. Besides acceptance and WTP, various explanatory variables were also collected and assessed. A logistic regression and a multivariable linear regression were used to explore the explanatory variables influencing acceptance and WTP, respectively. Results: Among 407 respondents, 391 (96.0%) expressed acceptance of a free vaccination. The mean and median WTP was US$ 37.0(95%CI:US$ 32.76-US$ 41.23) and US$ 17.90(95%CI:US$ 17.90-US$ 17.90), respectively. In an unadjusted analysis, those 30 years old or younger had 2.94 times greater odds of vaccine acceptance compared to those who were older (95%CI: 1.07-8.08). Location of alma mater, type of workplace, length of individual medical experience, and monthly income of GPs were all significantly associated with WTP. Conclusion: Although the vast majority of GPs would accept a freely provided vaccine, they were also somewhat price sensitive. This finding indicates that partial subsidy maybe required to achieve high vaccine coverage, particularly among GPs at community health centres or those with a shorter duration of medical practice.	1	Information Unavailable	Indonesia; Monkeypox; Prevention; Vaccine acceptance; Willingness to pay	10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.08.034	Harapan H, Wagner AL, Yufika A, Setiawan AM, Anwar S, Wahyuni S, Asrizal FW, Sufri MR, Putra RP, Wijayanti NP, Salwiyadi S, Maulana R, Khusna A, Nusrina I, Shidiq M, Fitriani D, Muharrir M, Husna CA, Yusri F, Maulana R, Rajamoorthy Y, Groneberg DA, Müller R, Mudatsir M.

2844429	Human monkeypox: secondary attack rates	Data on human monkeypox collected in Zaire during the six years 1981-86 were analysed to assess the extent of interhuman transmission of monkeypox virus. Among the 2278 persons who had close contact with 245 monkeypox patients infected from an animal source, 93 fell ill and were presumed to have been infected from the known human source: 69 of these were spread in the first generation, 19 in the second generation, and the remaining five cases in the third and fourth generation.The secondary attack rates were correlated with the age, sex, place of residence, and vaccination status of the contacts. There was an overall 3% probability of becoming ill following infection from a known human source. The affected household was the main focal point for interhuman transmission of monkeypox virus. The highest attack rate (11.7%) occurred among unvaccinated household contacts in the age group 0-4 years. However, the majority of susceptible persons who had been close to patients in the confined space of poorly ventilated huts failed to develop illness. There was no evidence of an increase in the secondary attack rate between 1970-80 and 1981-86.The inefficient spread from person to person, even in conditions of maximum exposure, supports the concept that monkeypox virus is poorly adapted for sustained transmission between humans and that such transmission does not pose a significant health problem.	24	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Grab B, Szczeniowski MV, Paluku KM, Mutombo M.

22225589	In vitro inhibition of monkeypox virus production and spread by Interferon-β	Background: The Orthopoxvirus genus contains numerous virus species that are capable of causing disease in humans, including variola virus (the etiological agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and vaccinia virus (the prototypical member of the genus). Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease that is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is characterized by systemic lesion development and prominent lymphadenopathy. Like variola virus, monkeypox virus is a high priority pathogen for therapeutic development due to its potential to cause serious disease with significant health impacts after zoonotic, accidental, or deliberate introduction into a naïve population. Results: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of interferon-β (IFN-β) for use against monkeypox virus. We found that treatment with human IFN-β results in a significant decrease in monkeypox virus production and spread in vitro. IFN-β substantially inhibited monkeypox virus when introduced 6-8 h post infection, revealing its potential for use as a therapeutic. IFN-β induced the expression of the antiviral protein MxA in infected cells, and constitutive expression of MxA was shown to inhibit monkeypox virus infection. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the successful inhibition of monkeypox virus using human IFN-β and suggest that IFN-β could potentially serve as a novel safe therapeutic for human monkeypox disease.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-9-5	Johnston SC, Lin KL, Connor JH, Ruthel G, Goff A, Hensley LE.

The location of each case is within areas predicted to be suitable for MPX virus transmission based on an ecological niche model.

9132583	Human monkeypox--Kasai Oriental, Zaire, 1996-1997	Monkeypox is an orthopoxvirus with enzootic circulation in rainforests of central and western Africa; the virus can be transmitted to humans and cause a syndrome clinically similar to smallpox (e.g., pustular rash, fever, respiratory symptoms, and in some cases, death). From February through August 1996, a total of 71 clinical cases of monkeypox, including six deaths, occurred in 13 villages in Africa in the Katako-Kombe health zone (1996 combined population: 15,698), Sankuru subregion, Kasai Oriental, Zaire. During the initial investigation of this cluster of human cases, specimens of serum and/or crusted scab or fluid from vesicles were collected from 11 patients, and monkeypox virus infection was confirmed in all 11 patients by the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Smallpox and Other Poxvirus Infections at CDC. Preliminary DNA phylogenetic studies of this strain of virus indicated only minor genetic variation compared with other strains of monkeypox virus from Zaire collected during 1970-1979. Because of reports by local public health officials of ongoing disease transmission, the Zaire Ministry of Health and WHO organized a follow-up investigation in February 1997 to characterize the magnitude of the outbreak. This report summarizes the preliminary results of the ongoing multidisciplinary investigation, which suggest that person-to-person transmission accounted for most monkeypox cases investigated in 1996 and 1997; in contrast, during previous years, reports were primarily for sporadic cases that resulted from animal-to-human transmission.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

28972544	Assessing Monkeypox Virus Prevalence in Small Mammals at the Human-Animal Interface in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	During 2012, 2013 and 2015, we collected small mammals within 25 km of the town of Boende in Tshuapa Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The prevalence of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in this area is unknown; however, cases of human infection were previously confirmed near these collection sites. Samples were collected from 353 mammals (rodents, shrews, pangolins, elephant shrews, a potamogale, and a hyrax). Some rodents and shrews were captured from houses where human monkeypox cases have recently been identified, but most were trapped in forests and agricultural areas near villages. Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to assess evidence of MPXV infection and other Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) infections in these small mammals. Seven (2.0%) of these animal samples were found to be anti-orthopoxvirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody positive (six rodents: two Funisciurus spp.; one Graphiurus lorraineus; one Cricetomys emini; one Heliosciurus sp.; one Oenomys hypoxanthus, and one elephant shrew Petrodromus tetradactylus); no individuals were found positive in PCR-based assays. These results suggest that a variety of animals can be infected with OPXVs, and that epidemiology studies and educational campaigns should focus on animals that people are regularly contacting, including larger rodents used as protein sources.	19	Information Unavailable	habitat analysis; human–animal interface; monkeypox; orthopoxviruses; serology; small mammals; wildlife	10.3390/v9100283	Doty JB, Malekani JM, Kalemba LN, Stanley WT, Monroe BP, Nakazawa YU, Mauldin MR, Bakambana TL, Liyandja Dja Liyandja T, Braden ZH, Wallace RM, Malekani DV, McCollum AM, Gallardo-Romero N, Kondas A, Peterson AT, Osorio JE, Rocke TE, Karem KL, Emerson GL, Carroll DS.

27467578	Monkeypox virus induces the synthesis of less dsRNA than vaccinia virus, and is more resistant to the anti-poxvirus drug, IBT, than vaccinia virus	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection fails to activate the host anti-viral protein, PKR, despite lacking a full-length homologue of the vaccinia virus (VACV) PKR inhibitor, E3. Since PKR can be activated by dsRNA produced during a viral infection, we have analyzed the accumulation of dsRNA in MPXV-infected cells. MPXV infection led to less accumulation of dsRNA than VACV infection. Because in VACV infections accumulation of abnormally low amounts of dsRNA is associated with mutations that lead to resistance to the anti-poxvirus drug isatin beta-thiosemicarbazone (IBT), we investigated the effects of treatment of MPXV-infected cells with IBT. MPXV infection was eight-fold more resistant to IBT than wild-type vaccinia virus (wtVACV). These results demonstrate that MPXV infection leads to the accumulation of less dsRNA than wtVACV, which in turn likely leads to a decreased capacity for activation of the dsRNA-dependent host enzyme, PKR.	10	Information Unavailable	E3 gene; F3 gene; IBT resistance; Innate immune evasion; Monkeypox virus; Poxvirus pathogenesis; Poxvirus transcription; Vaccinia virus; Virulence; dsRNA	10.1016/j.virol.2016.07.016	Arndt WD, White SD, Johnson BP, Huynh T, Liao J, Harrington H, Cotsmire S, Kibler KV, Langland J, Jacobs BL.

32698399	IMVAMUNE ® and ACAM2000 ® Provide Different Protection against Disease When Administered Postexposure in an Intranasal Monkeypox Challenge Prairie Dog Model	The protection provided by smallpox vaccines when used after exposure to Orthopoxviruses is poorly understood. Postexposu re administration of 1st generation smallpox vaccines was effective during eradication. However, historical epidemiological reports and animal studies on postexposure vaccination are difficult to extrapolate to today's populations, and 2nd and 3rd generation vaccines, developed after eradication, have not been widely tested in postexposure vaccination scenarios. In addition to concerns about preparedness for a potential malevolent reintroduction of variola virus, humans are becoming increasingly exposed to naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxviruses and, following these exposures, disease severity is worse in individuals who never received smallpox vaccination. This study investigated whether postexposure vaccination of prairie dogs with 2nd and 3rd generation smallpox vaccines was protective against monkeypox disease in four exposure scenarios. We infected animals with monkeypox virus at doses of 104 pfu (2× LD50) or 106 pfu (170× LD50) and vaccinated the animals with IMVAMUNE® or ACAM2000® either 1 or 3 days after challenge. Our results indicated that postexposure vaccination protected the animals to some degree from the 2× LD50, but not the 170× LD5 challenge. In the 2× LD50 challenge, we also observed that administration of vaccine at 1 day was more effective than administration at 3 days postexposure for IMVAMUNE®, but ACAM2000® was similarly effective at either postexposure vaccination time-point. The effects of postexposure vaccination and correlations with survival of total and neutralizing antibody responses, protein targets, take formation, weight loss, rash burden, and viral DNA are also presented.

24210113	Characterizing monkeypox virus specific CD8+ T cell epitopes in rhesus macaques	To characterize T cell epitopes in monkeypox virus (MPXV) infected rhesus macaques, we utilized IFNγ Elispot assay to screen 400 predicted peptides from 20MPXV proteins. Two peptides from the F8L protein, an analog of E9L protein in vaccinia, were found to elicit CD8+ T cell responses. Prediction and in vitro MHC binding analyses suggest that one is restricted by Mamu-A1(⁎)001 and another by Mamu-A1(⁎)002. The Mamu-A1(⁎)002 epitope is completely identical in all reported sequences for variola, vaccinia, cowpox and MPXV. The Mamu-A1(⁎)001 epitope is conserved in MPXV and vaccinia, and has one residue substitution (V6>I) in some cowpox sequences and all variola sequences. Given CD8+ T-cell epitopes from E9L were also identified in humans and mice, our data suggested that F8L/E9L may be a dominant pox viral protein for CD8+ T cell responses, and may be considered as a target when designing vaccines that target pox-specific T cell responses.

31677948	Co-administration of tecovirimat and ACAM2000™ in non-human primates: Effect of tecovirimat treatment on ACAM2000 immunogenicity and efficacy versus lethal monkeypox virus challenge	Naturally occurring smallpox has been eradicated but research stocks of variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, still exist in secure laboratories. Clandestine stores of the virus or resurrection of VARV via synthetic biology are possible and have led to concerns that VARV could be used as a biological weapon. The US government has prepared for such an event by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and TPOXX®, SIGA Technologies' smallpox antiviral drug. While vaccination is effective as a pre-exposure prophylaxis, protection is limited when administered following exposure. Safety concerns preclude general use of the vaccine unless there is a smallpox outbreak. TPOXX is approved by the FDA for use after confirmed diagnosis of smallpox disease. Tecovirimat, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in TPOXX, targets a highly conserved orthopoxviral protein, inhibiting long-range dissemination of virus. Although indications for use of the vaccine and TPOXX do not overlap, concomitant use is possible, especially if the TPOXX indication is expanded to include post-exposure prophylaxis. It is therefore important to understand how vaccine and TPOXX may interact. In studies presented here, monkeys were vaccinated with the ACAM2000TM live attenuated smallpox vaccine and concomitantly treated with tecovirimat or placebo. Immune responses to the vaccine and protective efficacy versus a lethal monkeypox virus (MPXV) challenge were evaluated. In two studies, primary and anamnestic humoral immune responses were similar regardless of tecovirimat treatment while the third study showed reduction in vaccine elicited humoral immunity. Following lethal MPXV challenge, all (12 of 12) vaccinated/placebo treated animals survived, and 12 of 13 vaccinated/tecovirimat treated animals survived. Clinical signs of disease were elevated in tecovirimat treated animals compared to placebo treated animals. This suggests that TPOXX may affect the immunogenicity of ACAM2000 if administered concomitantly. These studies may inform on how vaccine and TPOXX are used during a smallpox outbreak.	2	Comparative Study	ACAM2000; Animal Rule; Antiviral; Biodefense; Monkeypox virus; ST-246®; Smallpox; TPOXX®; Tecovirimat; Vaccinia; Variola	10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.10.049	Russo AT, Berhanu A, Bigger CB, Prigge J, Silvera PM, Grosenbach DW, Hruby D.

18394277	Retrospective analysis of monkeypox infection	Serologic cross-reactivity between orthopoxviruses is a substantial barrier to laboratory diagnosis of specific orthopoxvirus infections and epidemiologic characterization of disease outbreaks. Historically, time-consuming and labor-intensive strategies such as cross-adsorbed neutralization assays, immunofluorescence assays, and hemagglutination-inhibition assays have been used to identify orthopoxvirus infections. We used cross-adsorption to develop a simple and quantitative postadsorption ELISA for distinguishing between monkeypox and vaccinia infections. Despite the difficulty of diagnosing clinically inapparent monkeypox in previously vaccinated persons, this technique exhibited 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for identifying clinically overt monkeypox infection irrespective of vaccination history. We also describe a Western blot technique in which up to 3 diagnostic bands may be used to distinguish between vaccinia and monkeypox infection. The techniques described provide independent diagnostic tests suitable for retrospective analysis of monkeypox outbreaks.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1404.071044	Dubois ME, Slifka MK.

4538035	Studies on monkeypox virus	The growth characteristics, including ceiling temperatures for growth, of three strains of monkeypox virus were studied on chick chorioallantoic membrane, growth and plaque formation were studied in RK13 cells, and growth was studied in rabbit dermis. The three strains could not be distinguished by these tests but could be differentiated from variola, vaccinia, and cowpox viruses. Haemagglutination-inhibition tests with homologous and heterologous antisera also showed that the monkeypox strains were indistinguishable, although they could be differentiated from vaccinia and cowpox, but not from variola, viruses. Similar results were obtained in neutralization tests. It is suggested that the monkeypox strains constitute a homogeneous poxvirus entity. The strains can be differentiated from other poxviruses by their cultural characteristics but serologically they are more closely related to variola than to vaccinia or cowpox viruses.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Rondle CJ, Sayeed KA.

Monkeypox had been recognized in one of the patients by virus isolation, and had been suspected in the others for epidemiological reasons. Vaccinia-specific antibodies were found in 4 human sera collected 6 weeks after smallpox vaccination.The serological results provide the first laboratory evidence of a monkeypox reservoir in wild monkeys.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Gispen R, Brand-Saathof BB, Hekker AC.

15109408	Monkeypox transmission and pathogenesis in prairie dogs	During May and June 2003, the first cluster of human monkeypox cases in the United States was reported. Most patients with this febrile vesicular rash illness presumably acquired the infection from prairie dogs. Monkeypox virus was demonstrated by using polymerase chain reaction in two prairie dogs in which pathologic studies showed necrotizing bronchopneumonia, conjunctivitis, and tongue ulceration. Immunohistochemical assays for orthopoxviruses demonstrated abundant viral antigens in surface epithelial cells of lesions in conjunctiva and tongue, with less amounts in adjacent macrophages, fibroblasts, and connective tissues. Viral antigens in the lung were abundant in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Virus isolation and electron microscopy demonstrated active viral replication in lungs and tongue. These findings indicate that both respiratory and direct mucocutaneous exposures are potentially important routes of transmission of monkeypox virus between rodents and to humans. Prairie dogs offer insights into transmission, pathogenesis, and new vaccine and treatment trials because they are susceptible to severe monkeypox infection.	62	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1003.030878	Guarner J, Johnson BJ, Paddock CD, Shieh WJ, Goldsmith CS, Reynolds MG, Damon IK, Regnery RL, Zaki SR; Veterinary Monkeypox Virus Working Group.

28827792	Characterization of Monkeypox virus infection in African rope squirrels (Funisciurus sp.)	Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa and is caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the most virulent Orthopoxvirus affecting humans since the eradication of Variola virus (VARV). Many aspects of the MPXV transmission cycle, including the natural host of the virus, remain unknown. African rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.) are considered potential reservoirs of MPXV, as serosurveillance data in Central Africa has confirmed the circulation of the virus in these rodent species [1,2]. In order to understand the tissue tropism and clinical signs associated with infection with MPXV in these species, wild-caught rope squirrels were experimentally infected via intranasal and intradermal exposure with a recombinant MPXV strain from Central Africa engineered to express the luciferase gene. After infection, we monitored viral replication and shedding via in vivo bioluminescent imaging, viral culture and real time PCR. MPXV infection in African rope squirrels caused mortality and moderate to severe morbidity, with clinical signs including pox lesions in the skin, eyes, mouth and nose, dyspnea, and profuse nasal discharge. Both intranasal and intradermal exposures induced high levels of viremia, fast systemic spread, and long periods of viral shedding. Shedding and luminescence peaked at day 6 post infection and was still detectable after 15 days. Interestingly, one sentinel animal, housed in the same room but in a separate cage, also developed severe MPX disease and was euthanized. This study indicates that MPXV causes significant pathology in African rope squirrels and infected rope squirrels shed large quantities of virus, supporting their role as a potential source of MPXV transmission to humans and other animals in endemic MPX regions.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005809	Falendysz EA, Lopera JG, Doty JB, Nakazawa Y, Crill C, Lorenzsonn F, Kalemba LN, Ronderos MD, Mejia A, Malekani JM, Karem K, Carroll DS, Osorio JE, Rocke TE.

29927927	Intranasal monkeypox marmoset model: Prophylactic antibody treatment provides benefit against severe monkeypox virus disease	Concerns regarding outbreaks of human monkeypox or the potential reintroduction of smallpox into an immunological naïve population have prompted the development of animal models and countermeasures. Here we present a marmoset model of monkeypox and smallpox disease utilizing a relevant poxvirus via a natural exposure route. We found that 1000 plaque forming units (PFU) of Monkeypox virus was sufficient to recapitulate smallpox disease, to include an incubation period of approximately 13 days, followed by the onset of rash, and death between 15 and 17 days. Temporally accurate manifestation of viremia and oral shedding were also features. The number of lesions ranged from no lesions to 299, the most reported in a marmoset exposed to a poxvirus. To both evaluate the efficacy of our antibodies and the applicability of the model system, marmosets were prophylactically treated with two monoclonal antibodies, c7D11 and c8A. Of three marmosets, two were completely free of disease and a single marmoset died 8 days after the mock (n = 1) or PBS control(s) (n = 2). Evaluation of the serum levels of the three animals provided a possible explanation to the animal succumbing to disease. Interestingly, more females had lesions (and a greater number of lesions) and lower viral burden (viremia and oral shedding) than males in our studies, suggesting a possible gender effect.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0006581	Mucker EM, Wollen-Roberts SE, Kimmel A, Shamblin J, Sampey D, Hooper JW.

25462353	Attenuation of monkeypox virus by deletion of genomic regions	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an emerging pathogen from Africa that causes disease similar to smallpox. Two clades with different geographic distributions and virulence have been described. Here, we utilized bioinformatic tools to identify genomic regions in MPXV containing multiple virulence genes and explored their roles in pathogenicity; two selected regions were then deleted singularly or in combination. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that these regions play a significant role in MPXV replication, tissue spread, and mortality in mice. Interestingly, while deletion of either region led to decreased virulence in mice, one region had no effect on in vitro replication. Deletion of both regions simultaneously also reduced cell culture replication and significantly increased the attenuation in vivo over either single deletion. Attenuated MPXV with genomic deletions present a safe and efficacious tool in the study of MPX pathogenesis and in the identification of genetic factors associated with virulence.	4	Information Unavailable	In vivo bioluminescence imaging; Monkeypox virus; Monkeypox virus pathogenesis; Vaccinia virus; Variola virus; Viral replication; Virulence factors	10.1016/j.virol.2014.11.009	Lopera JG, Falendysz EA, Rocke TE, Osorio JE.

The detection of >400 MPX cases in less than a month in May 2022, across many countries underscores the epidemic potential of MPX in humans and demonstrates several important research gaps. First, the true burden of MPX in West and Central Africa is poorly understood, although it is critical for prevention and control of future outbreaks. Second, the diversity and extent of the animal reservoir remain unknown. We hypothesize that the synanthropic rodent population has increased in recent years in Africa leading to more human-rodent interactions and thus increased transmission of MPXV. We further hypothesise that nearly 45 years after the end of routine smallpox vaccination, the larger and more interconnected immune-naïve population has crossed a threshold resulting in more sustainable human-to-human transmission of MPXV. The current epidemic in the Western World is possibly a consequence of increased local transmission of MPXV in Africa. A new estimation of the basic and effective reproduction rate (R0 and Re) in different populations is required. National, regional, and international collaborations are needed to address research gaps related to MPX outbreaks.

28894977	Varicella Coinfection in Patients with Active Monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	From 2006 to 2007, an active surveillance program for human monkeypox (MPX) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified 151 cases of coinfection with monkeypox virus and varicella zoster virus from 1158 suspected cases of human MPX (13%). Using clinical and socio-demographic data collected with standardized instruments by trained, local nurse supervisors, we examined a variety of hypotheses to explain the unexpectedly high proportion of coinfections among the sample, including the hypothesis that the two viruses occur independently. The probabilities of disease incidence and selection necessary to yield the observed sample proportion of coinfections under an assumption of independence are plausible given what is known and assumed about human MPX incidence. Cases of human MPX are expected to be underreported, and more coinfections are expected with improved surveillance.	6	Information Unavailable	Emerging infectious disease; Monkeypox; Selection bias; Surveillance; Varicella zoster virus	10.1007/s10393-017-1266-5	Hoff NA, Morier DS, Kisalu NK, Johnston SC, Doshi RH, Hensley LE, Okitolonda-Wemakoy E, Muyembe-Tamfum JJ, Lloyd-Smith JO, Rimoin AW.

35665517	Viruses monkeying around with surgical safety: Monkeypox preparedness in surgical settings	As of May 2022 public health authorities in Europe and North America reported a multi-country outbreak of Monkeypox (MPX). Although the future development of the epidemic situation can only be speculated, it poses a potential threat to the continuity of surgical care in the affected areas, if not globally. Consequently, developing MPX specific surgical safety protocols is a dire need. Adapting standard surgical safety protocols, particularly those developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, to MPX can help mitigate the impact of this outbreak on surgical patients and trainees. Integrating disinfection technology, telehealth and innovative educational tools in this effort can strengthen the infection control of MPX, improve epidemic preparedness in surgical wards and decrease the burden of surgical infections.

2853010	Monkeypox virus: ecology and public health significance	Recent investigations have revealed that monkeypox virus infections occur with a high prevalence in several species of squirrels belonging to the genus Funisciurus, less frequently in squirrels of the genus Heliosciurus, and rarely in forest-dwelling primates. These squirrels commonly inhabit the secondary forests around human settlements in the rural areas of Zaire, especially where oil palms are grown, and are rare in the primary rain forest.Human infection with monkeypox virus occurs most frequently in the 5-9-year-old age group, particularly in small villages where the children hunt and eat squirrels and other small mammals. As the populations are now increasing in number and can no longer feed on wild life alone for their animal protein requirements, the development of animal husbandry as a source of meat will certainly decrease the risk and the incidence of human monkeypox, even in areas where monkeypox virus is present in the local population of squirrels.Although population growth and economic development in western and central Africa will probably reduce the risk of human infection with monkeypox virus, visitors to these areas who are likely to come into contact with wild animals should be offered smallpox vaccination as a protection.	35	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Khodakevich L, Jezek Z, Messinger D.

32895964	Cutaneous manifestations of viral outbreaks	As the world tries to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, dermatologists are left in a lurch as there is a lacuna in dermatologic literature as well as training regarding the cutaneous manifestations of varied viral agents capable of causing epidemics/pandemics or the potential to be bio-weaponised. Such outbreaks have the potential to become a pandemic given this age of globalisation. The quote by George Santayana stands true 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it'. Thus, this article lends a perspective to the recent viral outbreaks and is aimed at summarising these agents and their clinical features to serve as a quick reference for dermatologists.

22496894	Elucidating the role of the complement control protein in monkeypox pathogenicity	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) causes a smallpox-like disease in humans. Clinical and epidemiological studies provide evidence of pathogenicity differences between two geographically distinct monkeypox virus clades: the West African and Congo Basin. Genomic analysis of strains from both clades identified a ∼10 kbp deletion in the less virulent West African isolates sequenced to date. One absent open reading frame encodes the monkeypox virus homologue of the complement control protein (CCP). This modulatory protein prevents the initiation of both the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation. In monkeypox virus, CCP, also known as MOPICE, is a ∼24 kDa secretory protein with sequence homology to this superfamily of proteins. Here we investigate CCP expression and its role in monkeypox virulence and pathogenesis. CCP was incorporated into the West African strain and removed from the Congo Basin strain by homologous recombination. CCP expression phenotypes were confirmed for both wild type and recombinant monkeypox viruses and CCP activity was confirmed using a C4b binding assay. To characterize the disease, prairie dogs were intranasally infected and disease progression was monitored for 30 days. Removal of CCP from the Congo Basin strain reduced monkeypox disease morbidity and mortality, but did not significantly decrease viral load. The inclusion of CCP in the West African strain produced changes in disease manifestation, but had no apparent effect on disease-associated mortality. This study identifies CCP as an important immuno-modulatory protein in monkeypox pathogenesis but not solely responsible for the increased virulence seen within the Congo Basin clade of monkeypox virus.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0035086	Hudson PN, Self J, Weiss S, Braden Z, Xiao Y, Girgis NM, Emerson G, Hughes C, Sammons SA, Isaacs SN, Damon IK, Olson VA.

15208646	Monkeypox virus detection in rodents using real-time 3&#x27;-minor groove binder TaqMan assays on the Roche LightCycler	During the summer of 2003, an outbreak of human monkeypox occurred in the Midwest region of the United States. In all, 52 rodents suspected of being infected with monkeypox virus were collected from an exotic pet dealer and from private homes. The rodents were euthanized and submitted for testing to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases by the Galesburg Animal Disease Laboratory, Illinois Department of Agriculture. The rodent tissue samples were appropriately processed and then tested by using an integrated approach involving real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, an antigen-detection immunoassay, and virus culture. We designed and extensively tested two specific real-time PCR assays for rapidly detecting monkeypox virus DNA using the Vaccinia virus F3L and N3R genes as targets. The assays were validated against panels of orthopox viral and miscellaneous bacterial DNAs. A pan-orthopox electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay was used to further confirm the presence of Orthopoxvirus infection of the rodents. Seven of 12 (58%) animals (seven of 52 (15%) of all animals) tested positive in both monkeypox-specific PCR assays and two additional pan-orthopox PCR assays (in at least one tissue). The ECL results showed varying degrees of agreement with PCR. One hamster and three gerbils were positive by both PCR and ECL for all tissues tested. In addition, we attempted to verify the presence of monkeypox virus by culture on multiple cell lines, by immunohistology, and by electron microscopy, with negative results. Sequencing the PCR products from the samples indicated 100% identity with monkeypox virus strain Zaire-96-I-16 (a human isolate from the Congo). These real-time PCR and ECL assays represent a significant addition to the battery of tests for the detection of various orthopoxviruses. In light of the recent monkeypox virus transmissions, early detection of the virus is crucial for both natural outbreaks and potential acts of bioterrorism.	21	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/labinvest.3700143	Kulesh DA, Loveless BM, Norwood D, Garrison J, Whitehouse CA, Hartmann C, Mucker E, Miller D, Wasieloski LP Jr, Huggins J, Huhn G, Miser LL, Imig C, Martinez M, Larsen T, Rossi CA, Ludwig GV.

22164263	Monkeypox disease transmission in an experimental setting: prairie dog animal model	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is considered the most significant human public health threat in the genus Orthopoxvirus since the eradication of variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox). MPXV is a zoonotic agent endemic to forested areas of Central and Western Africa. In 2003, MPXV caused an outbreak in the United States due to the importation of infected African rodents, and subsequent sequential infection of North American prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and humans. In previous studies, the prairie dog MPXV model has successfully shown to be very useful for understanding MPXV since the model emulates key characteristics of human monkeypox disease. In humans, percutaneous exposure to animals has been documented but the primary method of human-to-human MPXV transmission is postulated to be by respiratory route. Only a few animal model studies of MPXV transmission have been reported. Herein, we show that MPXV infected prairie dogs are able to transmit the virus to naive animals through multiple transmission routes. All secondarily exposed animals were infected with MPXV during the course of the study. Notably, animals secondarily exposed appeared to manifest more severe disease; however, the disease course was very similar to those of experimentally challenged animals including inappetence leading to weight loss, development of lesions, production of orthopoxvirus antibodies and shedding of similar levels or in some instances higher levels of MPXV from the oral cavity. Disease was transmitted via exposure to contaminated bedding, co-housing, or respiratory secretions/nasal mucous (we could not definitively say that transmission occurred via respiratory route exclusively). Future use of the model will allow us to evaluate infection control measures, vaccines and antiviral strategies to decrease disease transmission.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0028295	Hutson CL, Carroll DS, Gallardo-Romero N, Weiss S, Clemmons C, Hughes CM, Salzer JS, Olson VA, Abel J, Karem KL, Damon IK.

1331540	Independent evolution of monkeypox and variola viruses	Smallpox was eradicated more than 10 years ago, but infection with another Orthopoxvirus, monkeypox virus, can result in a clinical picture resembling smallpox. Human infection with monkeypox virus is extremely rare, not easily transmitted, and confined to the rain forest belt of Africa (Z. Jezek and F. Fenner, p. 81-102, in Human Monkeypox, 1988). Evidence that variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, might be readily derived from monkeypox virus was presented [S. S. Marennikova and E. M. Shelukhina, Nature (London) 276:291-292, 1978; S. S. Marennikova, E. M. Shelukhina, N. N. Maltseva, and G. R. Matsevich Intervirology 11:333-340, 1979], but this was not confirmed [K. R. Dumbell and L. C. Archard, Nature (London) 286:29-32, 1980] and was subsequently discounted (J. J. Esposito, J. H. Nakano, and J. F. Obijeski, Bull. W.H.O. 63:695-703, 1985). Although enough difference between the genomes of monkeypox and variola viruses to rule out a simple interconversion has been demonstrated [K. R. Dumbell and L. C. Archard, Nature (London) 286:29-32, 1980; J. J. Esposito and J. C. Knight, Virology 143:230-251, 1985; J. J. Esposito, J. H. Nakano, and J. F. Obijeski, Bull. W.H.O. 63:695-703, 1985; M. Mackett and L. C. Archard, J. Gen. Virol. 45:683-701, 1979], the possibility that monkeypox virus was a more remote ancestor of variola virus remained. We have now identified a sequence in monkeypox virus DNA which is a homolog of a 1,065-bp open reading frame in the conserved region of the variola virus genome but which has multiple deletions. This is strong evidence that monkeypox virus is not ancestral to variola virus and strengthens confidence in the long-term success of smallpox eradication.	2	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.66.12.7565-7567.1992	Douglass N, Dumbell K.

30571693	Sounding the alarm: Defining thresholds to trigger a public health response to monkeypox	Endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), monkeypox is a zoonotic disease that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. Observed fluctuations in reported cases over time raises questions about when it is appropriate to mount a public health response, and what specific actions should be taken. We evaluated three different thresholds to differentiate between baseline and heightened disease incidence, and propose a novel, tiered algorithm for public health action. Monkeypox surveillance data from Tshuapa Province, 2011-2013, were used to calculate three different statistical thresholds: Cullen, c-sum, and a World Health Organization (WHO) method based on monthly incidence. When the observed cases exceeded the threshold for a given month, that month was considered to be 'aberrant'. For each approach, the number of aberrant months detected was summed by year-each method produced vastly different results. The Cullen approach generated a number of aberrant signals over the period of consideration (9/36 months). The c-sum method was the most sensitive (30/36 months), followed by the WHO method (12/24 months). We conclude that triggering public health action based on signals detected by a single method may be inefficient and overly simplistic for monkeypox. We propose instead a response algorithm that integrates an objective threshold (WHO method) with contextual information about epidemiological and spatiotemporal links between suspected cases to determine whether a response should be operating under i) routine surveillance ii) alert status, or iii) outbreak status. This framework could be modified and adopted by national and zone level health workers in monkeypox-endemic countries. Lastly, we discuss considerations for selecting thresholds for monkeypox outbreaks across gradients of endemicity and public health resources.

15660652	Monkeypox virus: histologic, immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic findings	Background: Human monkeypox, an emerging viral zoonosis first recognized in Africa, has recently emerged in the mid-western US. Initially, it presents with skin eruptions and fevers with diaphoresis and rigors. Clinically, the skin lesions progress from papules to vesiculopustules to resolving eschars. Methods: Three cutaneous biopsy specimens from two patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-proven monkeypox were available for review. The histologic, immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic features were identified. Results: The clinical progression of lesions is mirrored histologically with ballooning degeneration of basal keratinocytes and spongiosis of a mildly acanthotic epidermis progressing to full thickness necrosis of a markedly acanthotic epidermis containing few viable keratinocytes. A lichenoid-mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate is present, which exhibits progressive exocytosis with the keratinocyte necrosis. Inflammation of the superficial and deep vascular plexes, eccrine units and follicles is also present. Viral cytopathic effect is manifest by multinucleated syncytial keratinocytes. Immunohistochemically, viral antigen is detected within keratinocytes of the lesional epidermis, follicular and eccrine epithelium and few dermal mononuclear cells. Electron microscopy reveals virions at various stages of assembly within the keratinocyte cytoplasm. Conclusions: The histologic differential diagnosis includes herpes simplex virus, varicella and other pox viruses, such as smallpox. The first one may be differentiated histologically, immunohistochemically and electron microscopically. The last two may be differentiated using PCR assay for the monkeypox extracellular-envelope virus protein gene.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.0303-6987.2005.00254.x	Bayer-Garner IB.

25600603	Cytokine modulation correlates with severity of monkeypox disease in humans	Background: Human monkeypox is a zoonotic disease endemic to parts of Africa. Similar to other orthopoxviruses, virus and host have considerable interactions through immunomodulation. These interactions likely drive the establishment of a productive infection and disease progression, resulting in the range of disease presentations and case fatality rates observed for members of the Orthopoxvirus genus. Objectives: Much of our understanding about the immune response to orthopoxvirus infection comes from either in vitro or in vivo studies performed in small animals or non-human primates. Here, we conducted a detailed assessment of cytokine responses to monkeypox virus using serum from acutely ill humans collected during monkeypox active disease surveillance (2005-2007) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Study design: Nineteen serum samples that were from patients with confirmed monkeypox virus infections were selected for cytokine profiling. Cytokine profiling was performed on the Bio-Rad Bioplex 100 system using a 30-plex human cytokine panel. Results: Cytokine profiling revealed elevated cytokine concentrations in all samples. Overproduction of certain cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2R, IL-10, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were observed in patients with serious disease (defined as >250 lesions based on the World Health Organization scoring system). Conclusions: The data suggest that cytokine modulation affects monkeypox disease severity in humans.	2	Information Unavailable	Cytokine; Cytokine storm; Monkeypox; Orthopoxvirus; Regulatory T cell	10.1016/j.jcv.2014.12.001	Johnston SC, Johnson JC, Stonier SW, Lin KL, Kisalu NK, Hensley LE, Rimoin AW.

27191380	Extended Human-to-Human Transmission during a Monkeypox Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	A >600% increase in monkeypox cases occurred in the Bokungu Health Zone of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the second half of 2013; this increase prompted an outbreak investigation. A total of 104 possible cases were reported from this health zone; among 60 suspected cases that were tested, 50 (48.1%) cases were confirmed by laboratory testing, and 10 (9.6%) tested negative for monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection. The household attack rate (i.e., rate of persons living with an infected person that develop symptoms of MPXV infection) was 50%. Nine families showed >1 transmission event, and >6 transmission events occurred within this health zone. Mean incubation period was 8 days (range 4-14 days). The high attack rate and transmission observed in this study reinforce the importance of surveillance and rapid identification of monkeypox cases. Community education and training are needed to prevent transmission of MPXV infection during outbreaks.	27	Information Unavailable	Africa; Democratic Republic of the Congo; animal diseases; incubation; monkeypox; monkeypox virus; orthopoxvirus; transmission; viruses; zoonosis	10.3201/eid2206.150579	Nolen LD, Osadebe L, Katomba J, Likofata J, Mukadi D, Monroe B, Doty J, Hughes CM, Kabamba J, Malekani J, Bomponda PL, Lokota JI, Balilo MP, Likafi T, Lushima RS, Ilunga BK, Nkawa F, Pukuta E, Karhemere S, Tamfum JJ, Nguete B, Wemakoy EO, McCollum AM, Reynolds MG.

29573840	Investigation of an outbreak of monkeypox in an area occupied by armed groups, Central African Republic	Background: Monkeypox is a zoonosis caused by an Orthopoxvirus of the Poxviridae family. Human infections are often severe and are a public health problem. Patients and method: We conducted a monkeypox outbreak investigation of suspected case patients in five villages of the Alindao-Mingala Health District following blood sample confirmation of the virus by the Institut Pasteur in Bangui. We aimed to determine disease characteristics, to describe the context and the risk factors, and to measure the incidence and case fatality. Patients were reported in the villages of Rehou 4, 5, Dalakere 1, Kongbo, and Pavika from August to October 2016. Data was collected on individual records when interviewing patients or parents. Results: A total of 26 patients were identified. The˂10 years and 21-30 years age groups were the most affected. The overall attack rate was 5 per 1000 inhabitants and the case fatality was 7.7%. Young age and the absence of smallpox vaccination were associated with severe presentations in 87.5% of cases. Conclusion: The annual number of monkeypox outbreaks increases in the Central African Republic with severe presentations and a high case fatality especially in children. Reinforcing the surveillance and characterization of circulating strains will provide information on the need for vaccine production.	8	Information Unavailable	Monkeypox; Outbreak; Zoonose; Zoonoses; Épidémie	10.1016/j.medmal.2018.02.010	Kalthan E, Tenguere J, Ndjapou SG, Koyazengbe TA, Mbomba J, Marada RM, Rombebe P, Yangueme P, Babamingui M, Sambella A, Nakoune ER.

17268575	Ecological niche and geographic distribution of human monkeypox in Africa	Monkeypox virus, a zoonotic member of the genus Orthopoxviridae, can cause a severe, smallpox-like illness in humans. Monkeypox virus is thought to be endemic to forested areas of western and Central Africa. Considerably more is known about human monkeypox disease occurrence than about natural sylvatic cycles of this virus in non-human animal hosts. We use human monkeypox case data from Africa for 1970-2003 in an ecological niche modeling framework to construct predictive models of the ecological requirements and geographic distribution of monkeypox virus across West and Central Africa. Tests of internal predictive ability using different subsets of input data show the model to be highly robust and suggest that the distinct phylogenetic lineages of monkeypox in West Africa and Central Africa occupy similar ecological niches. High mean annual precipitation and low elevations were shown to be highly correlated with human monkeypox disease occurrence. The synthetic picture of the potential geographic distribution of human monkeypox in Africa resulting from this study should support ongoing epidemiologic and ecological studies, as well as help to guide public health intervention strategies to areas at highest risk for human monkeypox.	29	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0000176	Levine RS, Peterson AT, Yorita KL, Carroll D, Damon IK, Reynolds MG.

29551886	Evolution of Synonymous Codon Usage Bias in West African and Central African Strains of Monkeypox Virus	The evolution of bias in synonymous codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes and the factors influencing its diversification have not been reported so far. In this study, various trends associated with synonymous codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes were investigated, and the results are reported. Identification of factors that influence codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes was done using various codon usage indices, such as the relative synonymous codon usage, the effective number of codons, and the codon adaptation index. The Spearman rank correlation analysis and a correspondence analysis were used for correlating various factors with codon usage. The results revealed that mutational pressure due to compositional constraints, gene expression level, and selection at the codon level for utilization of putative optimal codons are major factors influencing synonymous codon usage bias in monkeypox viral genomes. A cluster analysis of relative synonymous codon usage values revealed a grouping of more virulent strains as one major cluster (Central African strains) and a grouping of less virulent strains (West African strains) as another major cluster, indicating a relationship between virulence and synonymous codon usage bias. This study concluded that a balance between the mutational pressure acting at the base composition level and the selection pressure acting at the amino acid level frames synonymous codon usage bias in the chosen monkeypox viruses. The natural selection from the host does not seem to have influenced the synonymous codon usage bias in the analyzed monkeypox viral genomes.	5	Information Unavailable	Monkeypox viruses (MPXV); mutational pressure; selection pressure; synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB)	10.1177/1176934318761368	Karumathil S, Raveendran NT, Ganesh D, Kumar Ns S, Nair RR, Dirisala VR.

28192435	Presumptive risk factors for monkeypox in rural communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a close relative of Variola virus, is a zoonotic virus with an unknown reservoir. Interaction with infected wildlife, bites from peri-domestic animals, and bushmeat hunting are hypothesized routes of infection from wildlife to humans. Using a Risk Questionnaire, performed in monkeypox-affected areas of rural Democratic Republic of the Congo, we describe the lifestyles and demographics associated with presumptive risk factors for MPXV infection. We generated two indices to assess risk: Household Materials Index (HMI), a proxy for socioeconomic status of households and Risk Activity Index (RAI), which describes presumptive risk for animal-to-human transmission of MPXV. Based on participant self-reported activity patterns, we found that people in this population are more likely to visit the forest than a market to fulfill material needs, and that the reported occupation is limited in describing behavior of individuals may participate. Being bitten by rodents in the home was commonly reported, and this was significantly associated with a low HMI. The highest scoring RAI sub-groups were 'hunters' and males aged ≥ 18 years; however, several activities involving MPXV-implicated animals were distributed across all sub-groups. The current analysis may be useful in identifying at-risk groups and help to direct education, outreach and prevention efforts more efficiently.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0168664	Quiner CA, Moses C, Monroe BP, Nakazawa Y, Doty JB, Hughes CM, McCollum AM, Ibata S, Malekani J, Okitolonda E, Carroll DS, Reynolds MG.

11189729	Monkeypoxvirus infections	During and after the smallpox eradication campaign, human cases of monkeypox appeared in West and Central Africa, as isolated cases or as small epidemics. Since inter-human transmission has never or only very exceptionally been documented, monkeypox does not represent a serious threat to humans. The virus reservoir is among tree squirrels living in the tropical rain forests of Africa and humans are infected by hunting, killing and skinning these animals. However, the modernization of society lessens human contact with the virus reservoir. Since the eradication of smallpox, stocks of variola virus have been maintained; whether these stocks should now be destroyed is a political question, which is seriously compromised by mistrust between countries.	1	Review	Information Unavailable	10.20506/rst.19.1.1207	Pattyn SR.

21994638	Monkeypox virus infections in small animal models for evaluation of anti-poxvirus agents	An ideal animal model for the study of a human disease is one which utilizes a route of infection that mimics the natural transmission of the pathogen; the ability to obtain disease with an infectious dose equivalent to that causing disease in humans; as well having a disease course, morbidity and mortality similar to that seen with human disease. Additionally, the animal model should have a mode(s) of transmission that mimics human cases. The development of small animal models for the study of monkeypox virus (MPXV) has been quite extensive for the relatively short period of time this pathogen has been known, although only a few of these models have been used to study anti-poxvirus agents. We will review those MPXV small animal models that have been developed thus far for the study of therapeutic agents.	13	Information Unavailable	animal models; monkeypox; therapeutics	10.3390/v2122763	Hutson CL, Damon IK.

11734207	Human monkeypox and smallpox viruses: genomic comparison	Monkeypox virus (MPV) causes a human disease which resembles smallpox but with a lower person-to-person transmission rate. To determine the genetic relationship between the orthopoxviruses causing these two diseases, we sequenced the 197-kb genome of MPV isolated from a patient during a large human monkeypox outbreak in Zaire in 1996. The nucleotide sequence within the central region of the MPV genome, which encodes essential enzymes and structural proteins, was 96.3% identical with that of variola (smallpox) virus (VAR). In contrast, there were considerable differences between MPV and VAR in the regions encoding virulence and host-range factors near the ends of the genome. Our data indicate that MPV is not the direct ancestor of VAR and is unlikely to naturally acquire all properties of VAR.	43	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03144-1	Shchelkunov SN, Totmenin AV, Babkin IV, Safronov PF, Ryazankina OI, Petrov NA, Gutorov VV, Uvarova EA, Mikheev MV, Sisler JR, Esposito JJ, Jahrling PB, Moss B, Sandakhchiev LS.

25653439	Sequence of pathogenic events in cynomolgus macaques infected with aerosolized monkeypox virus	"To evaluate new vaccines when human efficacy studies are not possible, the FDA's ""Animal Rule"" requires well-characterized models of infection. Thus, in the present study, the early pathogenic events of monkeypox infection in nonhuman primates, a surrogate for variola virus infection, were characterized. Cynomolgus macaques were exposed to aerosolized monkeypox virus (10(5) PFU). Clinical observations, viral loads, immune responses, and pathological changes were examined on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 postchallenge. Viral DNA (vDNA) was detected in the lungs on day 2 postchallenge, and viral antigen was detected, by immunostaining, in the epithelium of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveolar walls. Lesions comprised rare foci of dysplastic and sloughed cells in respiratory bronchioles. By day 4, vDNA was detected in the throat, tonsil, and spleen, and monkeypox antigen was detected in the lung, hilar and submandibular lymph nodes, spleen, and colon. Lung lesions comprised focal epithelial necrosis and inflammation. Body temperature peaked on day 6, pox lesions appeared on the skin, and lesions, with positive immunostaining, were present in the lung, tonsil, spleen, lymph nodes, and colon. By day 8, vDNA was present in 9/13 tissues. Blood concentrations of interleukin 1ra (IL-1ra), IL-6, and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) increased markedly. By day 10, circulating IgG antibody concentrations increased, and on day 12, animals showed early signs of recovery. These results define early events occurring in an inhalational macaque monkeypox infection model, supporting its use as a surrogate model for human smallpox. Importance: Bioterrorism poses a major threat to public health, as the deliberate release of infectious agents, such smallpox or a related virus, monkeypox, would have catastrophic consequences. The development and testing of new medical countermeasures, e.g., vaccines, are thus priorities; however, tests for efficacy in humans cannot be performed because it would be unethical and field trials are not feasible. To overcome this, the FDA may grant marketing approval of a new product based upon the ""Animal Rule,"" in which interventions are tested for efficacy in well-characterized animal models. Monkeypox virus infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) presents a potential surrogate disease model for smallpox. Previously, the later stages of monkeypox infection were defined, but the early course of infection remains unstudied. Here, the early pathogenic events of inhalational monkeypox infection in NHPs were characterized, and the results support the use of this surrogate model for testing human smallpox interventions."	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.03029-14	Tree JA, Hall G, Pearson G, Rayner E, Graham VA, Steeds K, Bewley KR, Hatch GJ, Dennis M, Taylor I, Roberts AD, Funnell SG, Vipond J.

22696658	Lethal monkeypox virus infection of CAST/EiJ mice is associated with a deficient gamma interferon response	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is endemic in Africa, where it causes disease in humans resembling smallpox. A recent importation of MPXV-infected animals into the United States raises the possibility of global spread. Rodents comprise the major reservoir of MPXV, and a variety of such animals, even those native to North America, are susceptible. In contrast, common inbred strains of mice, including BALB/c and C57BL/6, are greatly resistant to MPXV. However, several inbred strains of mice derived from wild mice, including CAST/EiJ, exhibit morbidity and mortality at relatively low inoculums of MPXV. Elucidating the basis for the susceptibility of CAST/EiJ mice could contribute to an understanding of MPXV pathogenicity and host defense mechanisms and enhance the value of this mouse strain as a model system for evaluation of therapeutics and vaccines. Here we compared virus dissemination and induced cytokine production in CAST/EiJ mice to those in the resistant BALB/c strain. Following intranasal infection, robust virus replication occurred in the lungs of both strains, although a relatively higher inoculum was required for BALB/c. However, while spread to other internal organs was rapid and efficient in CAST/EiJ mice, the virus was largely restricted to the lungs in BALB/c mice. Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and CCL5 were induced in lungs of BALB/c mice concomitant with virus replication but not in CAST/EiJ mice. The importance of IFN-γ in protection against MPXV disease was demonstrated by the intranasal administration of the mouse cytokine to CAST/EiJ mice and the resulting protection against MPXV. Furthermore, C57BL/6 mice with inactivation of the IFN-γ gene or the IFN-γ receptor gene exhibited enhanced sensitivity to MPXV.	27	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00162-12	Earl PL, Americo JL, Moss B.

9408046	Human monkeypox -- Kasai Oriental, Democratic Republic of Congo, February 1996-October 1997	Human monkeypox is a severe smallpox-like illness caused by monkeypox virus (MPV); monkeypox occurs in sporadic outbreaks, and infection is enzootic among squirrels and monkeys in the rainforests of western and central Africa. In 1996, cases of monkeypox were reported from villages in the Katako-Kombe Health Zone, Kasai Oriental, Zaire (i.e., Democratic Republic of Congo). The World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with CDC, investigated this outbreak and identified 92 suspected cases with onset during February 1996-February 1997, and isolated MPV from lesions of active cases. Cases continued to be reported, and a new investigation was initiated by WHO and CDC in October 1997. This report summarizes the results of the field investigation, which indicate that this is the largest human monkeypox outbreak ever recorded.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

24457084	Genomic variability of monkeypox virus among humans, Democratic Republic of the Congo	Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic virus endemic to Central Africa. Although active disease surveillance has assessed monkeypox disease prevalence and geographic range, information about virus diversity is lacking. We therefore assessed genome diversity of viruses in 60 samples obtained from humans with primary and secondary cases of infection from 2005 through 2007. We detected 4 distinct lineages and a deletion that resulted in gene loss in 10 (16.7%) samples and that seemed to correlate with human-to-human transmission (p = 0.0544). The data suggest a high frequency of spillover events from the pool of viruses in nonhuman animals, active selection through genomic destabilization and gene loss, and increased disease transmissibility and severity. The potential for accelerated adaptation to humans should be monitored through improved surveillance.	12	Information Unavailable	Democratic Republic of the Congo; Monkeypox virus; emerging infectious disease; gene loss; genomic diversity; genomic reduction; viruses	10.3201/eid2002.130118	Kugelman JR, Johnston SC, Mulembakani PM, Kisalu N, Lee MS, Koroleva G, McCarthy SE, Gestole MC, Wolfe ND, Fair JN, Schneider BS, Wright LL, Huggins J, Whitehouse CA, Wemakoy EO, Muyembe-Tamfum JJ, Hensley LE, Palacios GF, Rimoin AW.

The ages of the patients ranged from one month to 69 years; 90% were less than 15 years of age. The clinical picture was similar to that of the ordinary and modified forms of smallpox. Lymphadenopathy, occurring in the early stage of the illness, was the most important sign differentiating human monkeypox from smallpox and chickenpox. The symptoms, signs, and the course of the disease in patients who had been vaccinated against smallpox differed significantly from those in unvaccinated subjects. Pleomorphism and ""cropping"" similar to that in chickenpox occurred in 31% of vaccinated and 18% of unvaccinated patients. The prognosis depended largely on the presence of severe complications. No deaths occurred among vaccinated patients. In unvaccinated patients the crude case-fatality rate was 11% but was higher among the youngest children (15%)."	44	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/infdis/156.2.293	Jezek Z, Szczeniowski M, Paluku KM, Mutombo M.

20875278	Human monkeypox outbreak caused by novel virus belonging to Congo Basin clade, Sudan, 2005	To determine the outbreak source of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections in Unity State, Sudan, in November 2005, we conducted a retrospective investigation. MPXV was identified in a sub-Sahelian savannah environment. Three case notification categories were used: suspected, probable, and confirmed. Molecular, virologic, and serologic assays were used to test blood specimens, vesicular swabs, and crust specimens obtained from symptomatic and recovering persons. Ten laboratory-confirmed cases and 9 probable cases of MPXV were reported during September-December 2005; no deaths occurred. Human-to-human transmission up to 5 generations was described. Our investigation could not fully determine the source of the outbreak. Preliminary data indicate that the MPXV strain isolated during this outbreak was a novel virus belonging to the Congo Basin clade. Our results indicate that MPXV should be considered endemic to the wetland areas of Unity State. This finding will enhance understanding of the ecologic niche for this virus.	23	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1610.100713	Formenty P, Muntasir MO, Damon I, Chowdhary V, Opoka ML, Monimart C, Mutasim EM, Manuguerra JC, Davidson WB, Karem KL, Cabeza J, Wang S, Malik MR, Durand T, Khalid A, Rioton T, Kuong-Ruay A, Babiker AA, Karsani ME, Abdalla MS.

By their properties, they were identical to whitepox viruses formerly isolated from wildlife monkeys and rodents in Equatorial Africa. Besides stable 'white' clones, a number of virus cultures in the process of cloning were obtained which differed in quantitative content of virions, forming on CAM white pocks and pocks with hemorrhages. It appeared that the properties of the viral population as a whole (reaction type on rabbit skin, hemagglutination activity, etc.) depended on the rate of virions produced with different characteristics.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1159/000149055	Marennikova SS, Shelukhina EM, Maltseva NN, Matsevich GR.

15499541	Human monkeypox infection: a family cluster in the midwestern United States	Background: The outbreak of monkeypox in the Midwestern United States during June 2003 marks the first documented human infection in the Western Hemisphere. Consistent with those in outbreaks in Africa, most cases in this outbreak were associated with febrile rash illness. We describe a cluster of monkeypox in a family with a spectrum of clinical illness, including encephalitis, and outline the laboratory confirmation of monkeypox. Methods: Standardized patient information was collected by questionnaire and medical chart review; all cases described were laboratory confirmed. Laboratory methods included nucleic acid detection, viral culture, serologic testing, histopathologic evaluation, and immunohistochemical testing. Results: Of 3 family members with monkeypox, 2 had rash illness only, and 1 required hospitalization for severe encephalitis. The family member with the mildest clinical course had previously received smallpox vaccination. Diagnostic testing by both polymerase chain reaction and culture revealed infectious monkeypox virus in skin lesions of all 3 patients; 2 patients had orthopoxvirus detected by immunohistochemistry in skin lesions. The patient with encephalitis had orthopoxvirus-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM) in cerebrospinal fluid. All patients had detectable IgM responses to orthopoxvirus antigens. Conclusions: These 3 patients illustrate a spectrum of clinical illness with monkeypox despite a common source of exposure; manifestation and severity of illness may be affected by age and prior smallpox vaccination. We report that monkeypox, in addition to causing febrile rash illness, causes severe neurologic infection, and we discuss the use of novel laboratory tests for its diagnosis.	32	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1086/425039	Sejvar JJ, Chowdary Y, Schomogyi M, Stevens J, Patel J, Karem K, Fischer M, Kuehnert MJ, Zaki SR, Paddock CD, Guarner J, Shieh WJ, Patton JL, Bernard N, Li Y, Olson VA, Kline RL, Loparev VN, Schmid DS, Beard B, Regnery RR, Damon IK.

24147080	Monkeypox virus infection of rhesus macaques induces massive expansion of natural killer cells but suppresses natural killer cell functions	Natural killer (NK) cells play critical roles in innate immunity and in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infection. However, the response of NK cells to monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection is not well characterized. In this intravenous challenge study of MPXV infection in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), we analyzed blood and lymph node NK cell changes in absolute cell numbers, cell proliferation, chemokine receptor expression, and cellular functions. Our results showed that the absolute number of total NK cells in the blood increased in response to MPXV infection at a magnitude of 23-fold, manifested by increases in CD56+, CD16+, CD16-CD56- double negative, and CD16+CD56+ double positive NK cell subsets. Similarly, the frequency and NK cell numbers in the lymph nodes also largely increased with the total NK cell number increasing 46.1-fold. NK cells both in the blood and lymph nodes massively proliferated in response to MPXV infection as measured by Ki67 expression. Chemokine receptor analysis revealed reduced expression of CXCR3, CCR7, and CCR6 on NK cells at early time points (days 2 and 4 after virus inoculation), followed by an increased expression of CXCR3 and CCR5 at later time points (days 7-8) of infection. In addition, MPXV infection impaired NK cell degranulation and ablated secretion of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Our data suggest a dynamic model by which NK cells respond to MPXV infection of rhesus macaques. Upon virus infection, NK cells proliferated robustly, resulting in massive increases in NK cell numbers. However, the migrating capacity of NK cells to tissues at early time points might be reduced, and the functions of cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion were largely compromised. Collectively, the data may explain, at least partially, the pathogenesis of MPXV infection in rhesus macaques.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0077804	Song H, Josleyn N, Janosko K, Skinner J, Reeves RK, Cohen M, Jett C, Johnson R, Blaney JE, Bollinger L, Jennings G, Jahrling PB.

22013221	Evaluation of monkeypox disease progression by molecular imaging	Infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) with monkeypox virus (MPXV) is currently being developed as an animal model of variola infection in humans. We used positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) to identify inflammatory patterns as predictors for the outcome of MPXV disease in NHPs. Two NHPs were sublethally inoculated by the intravenous (IV) or intrabronchial (IB) routes and imaged sequentially using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG) uptake as a nonspecific marker of inflammation/immune activation. Inflammation was observed in the lungs of IB-infected NHPs, and bilobular involvement was associated with morbidity. Lymphadenopathy and immune activation in the axillary lymph nodes were evident in IV- and IB-infected NHPs. Interestingly, the surviving NHPs had significant (18)FDG uptake in the axillary lymph nodes at the time of MPXV challenge with no clinical signs of illness, suggesting an association between preexisting immune activation and survival. Molecular imaging identified patterns of inflammation/immune activation that may allow risk assessment of monkeypox disease.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/infdis/jir663	Dyall J, Johnson RF, Chen DY, Huzella L, Ragland DR, Mollura DJ, Byrum R, Reba RC, Jennings G, Jahrling PB, Blaney JE, Paragas J.

Because orthopoxvirus infections resulting from occupational exposures can be serious, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has continued to recommend preexposure vaccination for these persons since 1980 (1), when smallpox was eradicated (2). In 2015, ACIP made recommendations for the use of ACAM2000, the only orthopoxvirus vaccine available in the United States at that time (3). During 2020-2021, ACIP considered evidence for use of JYNNEOS, a replication-deficient Vaccinia virus vaccine, as an alternative to ACAM2000. In November 2021, ACIP unanimously voted in favor of JYNNEOS as an alternative to ACAM2000 for primary vaccination and booster doses. With these recommendations for use of JYNNEOS, two vaccines (ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS) are now available and recommended for preexposure prophylaxis against orthopoxvirus infection among persons at risk for such exposures.

22028942	Assessing the effectiveness of a community intervention for monkeypox prevention in the Congo basin	Background: In areas where health resources are limited, community participation in the recognition and reporting of disease hazards is critical for the identification of outbreaks. This is particularly true for zoonotic diseases such as monkeypox that principally affect people living in remote areas with few health services. Here we report the findings of an evaluation measuring the effectiveness of a film-based community outreach program designed to improve the understanding of monkeypox symptoms, transmission and prevention, by residents of the Republic of the Congo (ROC) who are at risk for disease acquisition. Methodology/principal findings: During 90 days, monkeypox outreach was conducted for ∼23,860 people in northern ROC. Two hundred seventy-one attendees (selected via a structured sample) were interviewed before and after participating in a small-group outreach session. The proportion of interviewees demonstrating monkeypox-specific knowledge before and after was compared. Significant gains were measured in areas of disease recognition, transmission, and mitigation of risk. The ability to recognize at least one disease symptom and a willingness to take a family member with monkeypox to the hospital increased from 49 and 45% to 95 and 87%, respectively (p<0.001, both). Willingness to deter behaviors associated with zoonotic risk, such as eating the carcass of a primate found dead in the forest, remained fundamentally unchanged however, suggesting additional messaging may be needed. Conclusions/significance: These results suggest that our current program of film-based educational activities is effective in improving disease-specific knowledge and may encourage individuals to seek out the advice of health workers when monkeypox is suspected.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0001356	Roess AA, Monroe BP, Kinzoni EA, Gallagher S, Ibata SR, Badinga N, Molouania TM, Mabola FS, Mombouli JV, Carroll DS, MacNeil A, Benzekri NA, Moses C, Damon IK, Reynolds MG.

Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) has a similar presentation to that of MPX, and in areas where MPX is endemic these two illnesses are commonly mistaken. This study evaluated the diagnostic utility of two surveillance case definitions for MPX and specific clinical characteristics associated with laboratory-confirmed MPX cases. Methodology/principal findings: Data from a cohort of suspect MPX cases (identified by surveillance over the course of a 42 month period during 2009-2014) from DRC were used; real-time PCR diagnostic test results were used to establish MPX and VZV diagnoses. A total of 333 laboratory-confirmed MPX cases, 383 laboratory-confirmed VZV cases, and 36 cases that were determined to not be either MPX or VZV were included in the analyses. Significant (p<0.05) differences between laboratory-confirmed MPX and VZV cases were noted for several signs/symptoms including key rash characteristics. Both surveillance case definitions had high sensitivity and low specificities for individuals that had suspected MPX virus infections. Using 12 signs/symptoms with high sensitivity and/or specificity values, a receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that models for MPX cases that had the presence of 'fever before rash' plus at least 7 or 8 of the 12 signs/symptoms demonstrated a more balanced performance between sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Laboratory-confirmed MPX and VZV cases presented with many of the same signs and symptoms, and the analysis here emphasized the utility of including 12 specific signs/symptoms when investigating MPX cases. In order to document and detect endemic human MPX cases, a surveillance case definition with more specificity is needed for accurate case detection. In the absence of a more specific case definition, continued emphasis on confirmatory laboratory-based diagnostics is warranted.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005857	Osadebe L, Hughes CM, Shongo Lushima R, Kabamba J, Nguete B, Malekani J, Pukuta E, Karhemere S, Muyembe Tamfum JJ, Wemakoy Okitolonda E, Reynolds MG, McCollum AM.

23347770	Phylogenetic and ecologic perspectives of a monkeypox outbreak, southern Sudan, 2005	Identification of human monkeypox cases during 2005 in southern Sudan (now South Sudan) raised several questions about the natural history of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in Africa. The outbreak area, characterized by seasonally dry riverine grasslands, is not identified as environmentally suitable for MPXV transmission. We examined possible origins of this outbreak by performing phylogenetic analysis of genome sequences of MPXV isolates from the outbreak in Sudan and from differing localities. We also compared the environmental suitability of study localities for monkeypox transmission. Phylogenetically, the viruses isolated from Sudan outbreak specimens belong to a clade identified in the Congo Basin. This finding, added to the political instability of the area during the time of the outbreak, supports the hypothesis of importation by infected animals or humans entering Sudan from the Congo Basin, and person-to-person transmission of virus, rather than transmission of indigenous virus from infected animals to humans.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1902.121220	Nakazawa Y, Emerson GL, Carroll DS, Zhao H, Li Y, Reynolds MG, Karem KL, Olson VA, Lash RR, Davidson WB, Smith SK, Levine RS, Regnery RL, Sammons SA, Frace MA, Mutasim EM, Karsani ME, Muntasir MO, Babiker AA, Opoka L, Chowdhary V, Damon IK.

27783372	[Twelve cases of monkeypox virus outbreak in Bangassou District (Central African Republic) in December 2015]	An outbreak of monkeypox occurred in the district of Bangassou in 2015. The monkeypox is a re-emerging zoonosis of viral origin highly contagious. It is an eruptive fever which evolves in an epidemic manner. An investigation was held December 10, 2015, to February 10, 2016 in the focus of the epidemic. Its objective was to describe the epidemic according to the time, places and people and to determine the incidence and lethality of the disease. This was a descriptive study. The data collection was made by interview and using a linear plug composed of several sections. All suspected cases were taken into account. The interview was done with patients or the parents of sick children. The blood and the contents of the lesions were collected and sent to the laboratory of the Institut Pasteur in Bangui for confirmation. Our data were analyzed with Epi info7. In total 12 patients had been registered including 9 secondary cases. Patients aged 31 to 40 years and less than 10 years were most affected. In addition, adults were most affected by the disease (8/12). The average age was 25 years with extremes at 15 months and 41 years. The sex male/female ratio was 1. The overall attack rate of disease and lethality were 0.2 per 1000 inhabitants and 25% respectively. The fatality was 67% among children less than 10 years. Fever and rash were the main symptoms of the disease. Lymphadenopathy was present in 54.5%. Ten of the 12 patients were hospitalized (83%). The average duration of hospitalization was 13 days with the extremes 6 and 28 days. The monkeypox like smallpox remains a serious and fatal disease in children. A survey of animal reservoirs complained to identify strains of the virus is essential. During an outbreak, good communication and isolation of patients may break the chain of transmission. Other measures to limit their contact with the forest or virus reservoirs are to be encouraged.	7	Information Unavailable	Bakouma; Bandoufou; Bangassou; Central African Republic; Epidemic; Fadama; Investigation; Lingo; Madigui; Monkeypox; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zoonosis	10.1007/s13149-016-0516-z	Kalthan E, Dondo-Fongbia JP, Yambele S, Dieu-Creer LR, Zepio R, Pamatika CM.

16288398	Clinical characteristics of human monkeypox, and risk factors for severe disease	Background: Human monkeypox is an emerging smallpox-like illness that was identified for the first time in the United States during an outbreak in 2003. Knowledge of the clinical manifestations of monkeypox in adults is limited, and clinical laboratory findings have been unknown. Methods: Demographic information; medical history; smallpox vaccination status; signs, symptoms, and duration of illness, and laboratory results (hematologic and serum chemistry findings) were extracted from medical records of patients with a confirmed case of monkeypox in the United States. Two-way comparisons were conducted between pediatric and adult patients and between patients with and patients without previous smallpox vaccination. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors for severe disease (fever [temperature, > or =38.3 degrees C] and the presence of rash [> or =100 lesions]), activity and duration of hospitalization, and abnormal clinical laboratory findings were performed. Results: Of 34 patients with a confirmed case of monkeypox, 5 (15%) were defined as severely ill, and 9 (26%) were hospitalized for >48 h; no patients died. Previous smallpox vaccination was not associated with disease severity or hospitalization. Pediatric patients (age, < or =18 years) were more likely to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Nausea and/or vomiting and mouth sores were independently associated with a hospitalization duration of >48 h and with having > or =3 laboratory tests with abnormal results. Conclusion: Monkeypox can cause a severe clinical illness, with systemic signs and symptoms and abnormal clinical laboratory findings. In the appropriate epidemiologic context, monkeypox should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients with unusual vesiculopustular exanthems, mucosal lesions, gastrointestinal symptoms, and abnormal hematologic or hepatic laboratory findings. Clinicians evaluating a rash illness consistent with possible orthopoxvirus infection should alert public health officials and consider further evaluation.	47	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1086/498115	Huhn GD, Bauer AM, Yorita K, Graham MB, Sejvar J, Likos A, Damon IK, Reynolds MG, Kuehnert MJ.

18796610	Monkeypox virus evades antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by suppressing cognate T cell activation	Monkeypox virus (MPV) is a virulent human pathogen that has gained increased attention because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent and inadvertent introduction into North America in 2003. The US outbreak also provided an important opportunity to study MPV-specific T cell immunity. Although MPV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells could recognize vaccinia virus (VV)-infected monocytes and produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFNgamma and TNFalpha, they were largely incapable of responding to autologous MPV-infected cells. Further analysis revealed that, unlike cowpox virus (CPV), MPV did not interfere with MHC expression or intracellular transport of MHC molecules. Instead, MPV-infected cells were capable of preventing T cell receptor (TcR)-mediated T cell activation in trans. The ability to trigger a state of nonresponsiveness represents a unique MHC-independent mechanism for blocking antiviral T cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production and is likely an important attribute involved with viral dissemination in the infected host.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1073/pnas.0800589105	Hammarlund E, Dasgupta A, Pinilla C, Norori P, Früh K, Slifka MK.

21069425	Using remote sensing to map the risk of human monkeypox virus in the Congo Basin	Although the incidence of human monkeypox has greatly increased in Central Africa over the last decade, resources for surveillance remain extremely limited. We conducted a geospatial analysis using existing data to better inform future surveillance efforts. Using active surveillance data collected between 2005 and 2007, we identified locations in Sankuru district, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where there have been one or more cases of human monkeypox. To assess what taxa constitute the main reservoirs of monkeypox, we tested whether human cases were associated with (i) rope squirrels (Funisciurus sp.), which were implicated in monkeypox outbreaks elsewhere in the DRC in the 1980s, or (ii) terrestrial rodents in the genera Cricetomys and Graphiurus, which are believed to be monkeypox reservoirs in West Africa. Results suggest that the best predictors of human monkeypox cases are proximity to dense forests and associated habitat preferred by rope squirrels. The risk of contracting monkeypox is significantly greater near sites predicted to be habitable for squirrels (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.08-1.63). We recommend that semi-deciduous rainforests with oil-palm, the rope squirrel's main food source, be prioritized for monitoring.	23	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1007/s10393-010-0355-5	Fuller T, Thomassen HA, Mulembakani PM, Johnston SC, Lloyd-Smith JO, Kisalu NK, Lutete TK, Blumberg S, Fair JN, Wolfe ND, Shongo RL, Formenty P, Meyer H, Wright LL, Muyembe JJ, Buermann W, Saatchi SS, Okitolonda E, Hensley L, Smith TB, Rimoin AW.

16275790	Transmission of monkeypox among persons exposed to infected prairie dogs in Indiana in 2003	Objective: To describe a cluster of human monkeypox cases associated with exposure to ill prairie dogs in a home child care. Design, setting, participants: We identified all persons exposed to 2 pet prairie dogs in County A, Indiana; performed active surveillance for symptomatic monkeypox infection; and evaluated the types of exposure that may have resulted in infection. For children who attended the child care where the animals were housed, we also measured the rate of seroconversion to monkeypox virus. Main outcome measures: Nine (13%) of 70 persons exposed to the prairie dogs reported signs and symptoms of monkeypox. Two (40%) of 5 symptomatic child care attendees reported direct contact with the prairie dogs. Two (13%) of 15 child care attendees evaluated tested positive for IgM antibodies against orthopoxvirus; both reported symptoms consistent with monkeypox. Results: The risk of symptomatic infection correlated with the time and intensity of animal exposure, which was 100% (4/4) among family members with extensive direct contact, 19% (5/26) among the veterinarian and nonfamily child care attendees with moderate exposure, and 0% (0/40) among school children with limited exposure (P<.01). Conclusions: Monkeypox virus was transmitted from ill prairie dogs in a child care and veterinary facilities. The risk of symptomatic infection correlated with the amount of exposure to the prairie dogs. Although most cases of human monkeypox were associated with direct animal contact, other routes of transmission cannot be excluded.	17	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1001/archpedi.159.11.1022	Kile JC, Fleischauer AT, Beard B, Kuehnert MJ, Kanwal RS, Pontones P, Messersmith HJ, Teclaw R, Karem KL, Braden ZH, Damon I, Khan AS, Fischer M.

18639466	Monkeypox virus viral chemokine inhibitor (MPV vCCI), a potent inhibitor of rhesus macrophage inflammatory protein-1	Monkeypox virus (MPV) is an orthopoxvirus with considerable homology to variola major, the etiologic agent of smallpox. Although smallpox was eradicated in 1976, the outbreak of MPV in the U.S. highlights the health hazards associated with zoonotic infections. Like other orthopoxviruses, MPV encodes a secreted chemokine binding protein, vCCI that is abundantly expressed and secreted from MPV infected cells. EMSA data shows vCCI efficiently binds rhesus MIP-1alpha (rhMIP-1alpha) at near one to one stoichiometry. In vitro chemotaxis experiments demonstrate that vCCI completely inhibits rhMIP-1alpha mediated chemotaxis, while in vivo recruitment assays in rhesus macaques using chemokine-saturated implants show a decrease in the number of CD14(+) cells responding to rhMIP-1alpha when vCCI is present, suggesting vCCI is effectively inhibiting chemokine function both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, we demonstrate that vCCI can diminish the severity of the acute phase and completely inhibit the relapsing phase of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease. These data represent the first in vitro and in vivo characterization of vCCI emphasizing its function as a potent inhibitor of rhMIP-1alpha. Furthermore, the ability of vCCI to inhibit relapsing EAE disease represents a novel therapeutic approach for treating chemokine-mediated diseases.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.cyto.2008.05.016	Jones JM, Messauodi I, Estep RD, Orzechowska B, Wong SW.

2992305	Human monkeypox: a newly emerged orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forests of Africa	During the course of the recently concluded smallpox eradication program, a new human orthopoxvirus infection was discovered which is caused by monkeypox virus. The disease occurs sporadically in remote villages within tropical rain forests of West and Central Africa. The disease is rare; only 155 cases having been reported from 1970 to 1983. The symptoms and signs of human monkeypox resemble those of smallpox, differing significantly only in the occurrence of lymphadenopathy with human monkeypox disease. Of 155 cases, some 80% are believed to have resulted from infection from an as yet unknown animal reservoir; the rest occurred among unvaccinated close contacts among whom a secondary attack rate of 15% was observed. Although person-to-person spread appears to have occurred in some instances, few cases were observed in the third or fourth generation of transmission and none thereafter. Since 1982, the incidence of human monkeypox infections in Zaire has increased concomitant with an intensified surveillance program. Additional reasons which might explain the increased incidence are discussed. Further surveillance and research of this primarily zoonotic infection are warranted and are in progress.	38	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.1985.34.781	Arita I, Jezek Z, Khodakevich L, Ruti K.

22493109	Ecology and geography of human monkeypox case occurrences across Africa	As ecologic niche modeling (ENM) evolves as a tool in spatial epidemiology and public health, selection of the most appropriate and informative environmental data sets becomes increasingly important. Here, we build on a previous ENM analysis of the potential distribution of human monkeypox in Africa by refining georeferencing criteria and using more-diverse environmental data to identify environmental parameters contributing to monkeypox distributional ecology. Significant environmental variables include annual precipitation, several temperature-related variables, primary productivity, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and pH. The potential distribution identified with this set of variables was broader than that identified in previous analyses but does not include areas recently found to hold monkeypox in southern Sudan. Our results emphasize the importance of selecting the most appropriate and informative environmental data sets for ENM analyses in pathogen transmission mapping.	17	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.7589/0090-3558-48.2.335	Ellis CK, Carroll DS, Lash RR, Peterson AT, Damon IK, Malekani J, Formenty P.

23142251	Susceptibility of monkeypox virus aerosol suspensions in a rotating chamber	Viral aerosols can have a major impact on public health and on the dynamics of infection. Once aerosolized, viruses are subjected to various stress factors and their integrity and potential of infectivity can be altered. Empirical characterization is needed in order to predict more accurately the fate of these bioaerosols both for short term and long term suspension in the air. Here the susceptibility to aerosolization of the monkeypox virus (MPXV), associated with emerging zoonotic diseases, was studied using a 10.7 L rotating chamber. This chamber was built to fit inside a Class three biological safety cabinet, specifically for studying airborne biosafety level three (BSL3) microorganisms. Airborne viruses were detected by culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) after up to 90 h of aging. Viral concentrations detected dropped by two logs for culture analysis and by one log for qPCR analysis within the first 18 h of aging; viral concentrations were stable between 18 and 90 h, suggesting a potential for the MPXV to retain infectivity in aerosols for more than 90 h. The rotating chamber used in this study maintained viral particles airborne successfully for prolonged periods and could be used to study the susceptibility of other BSL3 microorganisms.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.10.009	Verreault D, Killeen SZ, Redmann RK, Roy CJ.

35656836	Epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of four cases of monkeypox support transmission through sexual contact, Italy, May 2022	Since May 2022, an outbreak of monkeypox has been ongoing in non-endemic countries. We report four cases in Italy in young adult men reporting condomless sexual intercourse. The patients are in good clinical condition with no need for specific antiviral drugs. Biological samples from seminal fluid were positive for monkeypox viral DNA. For many other viruses found in semen there is no evidence of sexual transmission. The possibility of sexual transmission of monkeypox virus needs to be investigated.

14736926	The detection of monkeypox in humans in the Western Hemisphere	Background: During May and June 2003, an outbreak of febrile illness with vesiculopustular eruptions occurred among persons in the midwestern United States who had had contact with ill pet prairie dogs obtained through a common distributor. Zoonotic transmission of a bacterial or viral pathogen was suspected. Methods: We reviewed medical records, conducted interviews and examinations, and collected blood and tissue samples for analysis from 11 patients and one prairie dog. Histopathological and electron-microscopical examinations, microbiologic cultures, and molecular assays were performed to identify the etiologic agent. Results: The initial Wisconsin cases evaluated in this outbreak occurred in five males and six females ranging in age from 3 to 43 years. All patients reported having direct contact with ill prairie dogs before experiencing a febrile illness with skin eruptions. We found immunohistochemical or ultrastructural evidence of poxvirus infection in skin-lesion tissue from four patients. Monkeypox virus was recovered in cell cultures of seven samples from patients and from the prairie dog. The virus was identified by detection of monkeypox-specific DNA sequences in tissues or isolates from six patients and the prairie dog. Epidemiologic investigation suggested that the prairie dogs had been exposed to at least one species of rodent recently imported into the United States from West Africa. Conclusions: Our investigation documents the isolation and identification of monkeypox virus from humans in the Western Hemisphere. Infection of humans was associated with direct contact with ill prairie dogs that were being kept or sold as pets.	198	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1056/NEJMoa032299	Reed KD, Melski JW, Graham MB, Regnery RL, Sotir MJ, Wegner MV, Kazmierczak JJ, Stratman EJ, Li Y, Fairley JA, Swain GR, Olson VA, Sargent EK, Kehl SC, Frace MA, Kline R, Foldy SL, Davis JP, Damon IK.

20805472	Major increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination campaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo	Studies on the burden of human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were last conducted from 1981 to 1986. Since then, the population that is immunologically naïve to orthopoxviruses has increased significantly due to cessation of mass smallpox vaccination campaigns. To assess the current risk of infection, we analyzed human monkeypox incidence trends in a monkeypox-enzootic region. Active, population-based surveillance was conducted in nine health zones in central DRC. Epidemiologic data and biological samples were obtained from suspected cases. Cumulative incidence (per 10,000 population) and major determinants of infection were compared with data from active surveillance in similar regions from 1981 to 1986. Between November 2005 and November 2007, 760 laboratory-confirmed human monkeypox cases were identified in participating health zones. The average annual cumulative incidence across zones was 5.53 per 10,000 (2.18-14.42). Factors associated with increased risk of infection included: living in forested areas, male gender, age < 15, and no prior smallpox vaccination. Vaccinated persons had a 5.2-fold lower risk of monkeypox than unvaccinated persons (0.78 vs. 4.05 per 10,000). Comparison of active surveillance data in the same health zone from the 1980s (0.72 per 10,000) and 2006-07 (14.42 per 10,000) suggests a 20-fold increase in human monkeypox incidence. Thirty years after mass smallpox vaccination campaigns ceased, human monkeypox incidence has dramatically increased in rural DRC. Improved surveillance and epidemiological analysis is needed to better assess the public health burden and develop strategies for reducing the risk of wider spread of infection.	149	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1073/pnas.1005769107	Rimoin AW, Mulembakani PM, Johnston SC, Lloyd Smith JO, Kisalu NK, Kinkela TL, Blumberg S, Thomassen HA, Pike BL, Fair JN, Wolfe ND, Shongo RL, Graham BS, Formenty P, Okitolonda E, Hensley LE, Meyer H, Wright LL, Muyembe JJ.

186209	Monkeypox and whitepox viruses in West and Central Africa	Prospects for the eradication of smallpox are now highly encouraging. With the cessation of man-to-man transmission, the question of possible animal reservoirs of smallpox becomes increasingly important. During the period 1970-1975, 20 cases of a smallpox-like disease were detected in smallpox-free areas of tropical rain forest in West and Central Africa. Epidemiological and virological investigations revealed that the disease was caused by an animal poxvirus termed monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopox virus group. The disease spread with difficulty even among susceptible close contacts and does not appear to be sufficiently transmissible to permit continuing infection to become established in man. During the investigations, four orthopox viruses termed whitepox viruses were isolated from rodents and monkeys. The isolates were not distinguishable from variola virus with currently available laboratory techniques, but there is no evidence so far that viruses of this group have infected man. Although there is now substantial and accumulating evidence that there is no animal reservoir for smallpox, continued surveillance and studies in West and Central Africa are warranted.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Arita I, Henderson DA.

5303409	Smallpox and monkeypox in non-human primates	In considering global eradication of smallpox the absence of an animal reservoir is important. Present knowledge of experimental infection of non-human primates with variola virus and of a related virus infection in monkeys, termed monkeypox, is examined.From the literature review and the results of a survey of captive monkeys in 26 major biological institutions it is concluded that outbreaks of supposed smallpox and monkeypox are not frequent and that man may be comparatively insusceptible to monkeypox. A natural reservoir of smallpox in non-human primates is thought to be unlikely although further studies are warranted since the survey reveals that certain species of monkeys can be infected with smallpox and that infected monkeys can transmit infection to others.	36	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Arita I, Henderson DA.

3018091	Human monkeypox: a study of 2,510 contacts of 214 patients	A study of 2,510 contacts of 214 patients with human monkeypox was conducted in Zaire from 1980 to 1984. Among the contacts of 130 primary cases of human monkeypox, a further 22 co-primary and 62 secondary cases were detected, and an additional fourteen people who had no evidence of clinical disease had positive serological results. A majority of the clinical and subclinical cases of monkeypox occurred in children less than 10 years of age. Immunity in vaccinated persons now appears to be waning because 16 overt cases occurred in contacts who had been vaccinated. The overall attack rate for contacts without a vaccination scar (7.2%) differed significantly from the attack rate for those who had been vaccinated in the past (0.9%). The attack rate for household contacts was significantly higher than that for other contacts, among both unvaccinated (four times higher) and vaccinated (seven times higher) household contacts. Many unvaccinated contacts living in the same household as the index case under conditions of maximum exposure, however, escaped not only the disease but also infection.	20	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/infdis/154.4.551	Jezek Z, Marennikova SS, Mutumbo M, Nakano JH, Paluku KM, Szczeniowski M.

3029395	Serological survey for human monkeypox infections in a selected population in Zaire	About 3460 persons living in Kole zone of East Kasai, in Zaire, were examined and their sera screened initially by a haemagglutination-inhibition test. Of these, 667 (19%) were positive. Radioimmunoassay adsorption tests for the presence of monkeypox- or vaccinia-specific antibodies gave unequivocal results in 300 of these sera; the remaining 47 were nonspecific. Monkeypox-specific antibodies were found in sera of 27 individuals, of all ages and both sexes, giving an overall prevalence rate of monkeypox virus-specific antibodies of 0.8%. The prevalence rate was four times higher in the 5 to 9 year age group (1.3%) than in children aged 0 to 4 years (0.3%), and was highest (2.4%) in the 15 to 19 year age group. There was no significant difference in the prevalence rates between the sexes. As might be expected, there are substantially higher prevalence rates in persons living in forest galleries than in those in savannah, and among those living in areas where human monkeypox cases had occurred in the past compared with those living in other localities. Nineteen children whose sera showed specific monkeypox antibodies were re-examined. Twelve showed facial and body skin changes suggesting the presence of vesiculo-pustular disease in the past; four of these had been known registered monkeypox cases. Seven children had neither signs nor history of past vesiculo-pustular disease, suggesting that they had suffered from subclinical infection with monkeypox virus.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Nakano JH, Arita I, Mutombo M, Szczeniowski M, Dunn C.

12083817	Analysis of the monkeypox virus genome	Monkeypox virus (MPV) belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus of the family Poxviridae, is endemic in parts of Africa, and causes a human disease that resembles smallpox. The 196,858-bp MPV genome was analyzed with regard to structural features and open reading frames. Each end of the genome contains an identical but oppositely oriented 6379-bp terminal inverted repetition, which similar to that of other orthopoxviruses, includes a putative telomere resolution sequence and short tandem repeats. Computer-assisted analysis was used to identify 190 open reading frames containing >/=60 amino acid residues. Of these, four were present within the inverted terminal repetition. MPV contained the known essential orthopoxvirus genes but only a subset of the putative immunomodulatory and host range genes. Sequence comparisons confirmed the assignment of MPV as a distinct species of orthopoxvirus that is not a direct ancestor or a direct descendent of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox.	36	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1006/viro.2002.1446	Shchelkunov SN, Totmenin AV, Safronov PF, Mikheev MV, Gutorov VV, Ryazankina OI, Petrov NA, Babkin IV, Uvarova EA, Sandakhchiev LS, Sisler JR, Esposito JJ, Damon IK, Jahrling PB, Moss B.

22182595	Inhibition of cowpox virus and monkeypox virus infection by mitoxantrone	Mitoxantrone, an FDA-approved therapeutic for the treatment of cancer and multiple sclerosis, was previously reported to exhibit antiviral activity against vaccinia virus. To determine whether this activity extends to other orthopoxviruses, mitoxantrone was tested against cowpox and monkeypox. Mitoxantrone demonstrated an EC(50) of 0.25 μM against cowpox and 0.8 μM against monkeypox. Intraperitoneal treatment of cowpox virus-challenged C57Bl/6 mice with 0.5 mg/kg mitoxantrone resulted in 25% survival and a significant increase in survival time. In an effort to improve its efficacy, mitoxantrone was tested for synergistic activity with cidofovir. In vitro tests demonstrated significant synergy between the two drugs against cowpox; however, no synergistic effect on animal survival or median time-to-death was seen in intranasally-infected BALB/c mice. Significantly fewer animals survived when treated with a combination of 0.5 mg/kg mitoxantrone and 100 mg/kg cidofovir than with 100 mg/kg cidofovir alone. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of limited anti-orthopoxvirus activity by mitoxantrone in an animal model.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.12.001	Altmann SE, Smith AL, Dyall J, Johnson RF, Dodd LE, Jahrling PB, Paragas J, Blaney JE.

29982575	Effects of Treatment Delay on Efficacy of Tecovirimat Following Lethal Aerosol Monkeypox Virus Challenge in Cynomolgus Macaques	Background: Tecovirimat (ST-246) is being developed as an antiviral therapeutic for smallpox for use in the event of an accidental or intentional release. The last reported case of smallpox was 1978 but the potential for use of variola virus for biowarfare has renewed interest in smallpox antiviral therapeutics. Methods: Cynomolgus macaques were challenged with a lethal dose of monkeypox virus (MPXV) by aerosol as a model for human smallpox and treated orally with 10 mg/kg tecovirimat once daily starting up to 8 days following challenge. Monkeys were monitored for survival, lesions, and clinical signs of disease. Samples were collected for measurement of viremia by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and for white blood cell counts. Results: Survival in animals initiating treatment up to 5 days postchallenge was 100%. In animals treated starting 6, 7, or 8 days following challenge, survival was 67%, 100%, and 50%, respectively. Treatment initiation up to 4 days following challenge reduced severity of clinical manifestations of infection. Conclusions: Tecovirimat treatment initiated up to 8 days following a lethal aerosol MPXV challenge improves survival and, when initiated earlier than 5 days after challenge, provides protection from clinical effects of disease, supporting the conclusion that it is a promising smallpox antiviral therapeutic candidate.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/infdis/jiy326	Russo AT, Grosenbach DW, Brasel TL, Baker RO, Cawthon AG, Reynolds E, Bailey T, Kuehl PJ, Sugita V, Agans K, Hruby DE.

35658858	Appearance and re-appearance of zoonotic disease during the pandemic period: Long-term monitoring and analysis of zoonosis is crucial to confirm the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 and monkeypox virus	During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, along with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, another zoonotic origin virus emerged: monkeypox virus. Researchers are trying to screen the wild animals to pinpoint the exact origin of these viruses in both cases. For SARS-CoV-2, scientists who were studying the zoonotic transfer of the virus are currently divided along four distinct lines: the first group suspects the pangolin as the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; the second one is the bat origin of the virus; the third group includes both the pangolins and bat, and fourth group informed about the origin of several other animals. Similarly, scientists have noted significant host ranges of the virus for the monkeypox virus, such as monkeys, chimpanzees, rodents, prairie dogs, etc. Therefore, we should understand some essential points of the zoonosis of these two important viruses, such as animal origin, natural reservoir, intermediate hosts, virus spillover events (spillover time, and frequency of infecting the one host to another or reservoir to human), etc. We appeal for long-term monitoring through the teamwork of scientists involving the fields of wildlife biology, veterinary medicine,molecular biology, virology, health science, and computational biology. It is essential to create an integrated multi-national scientific task force with adequate funding from all countries originating in the regions of these two viruses. It could explore the mechanisms involving not only the SARS-CoV-2 and monkeypox virus origin, host range, and all spillover events of these viruses but also the future outbreak of wildlife-based epidemics.

21209900	Proteomic basis of the antibody response to monkeypox virus infection examined in cynomolgus macaques and a comparison to human smallpox vaccination	Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease that occurs primarily in Central and West Africa. A recent outbreak in the United States heightened public health concerns for susceptible human populations. Vaccinating with vaccinia virus to prevent smallpox is also effective for monkeypox due to a high degree of sequence conservation. Yet, the identity of antigens within the monkeypox virus proteome contributing to immune responses has not been described in detail. We compared antibody responses to monkeypox virus infection and human smallpox vaccination by using a protein microarray covering 92-95% (166-192 proteins) of representative proteomes from monkeypox viral clades of Central and West Africa, including 92% coverage (250 proteins) of the vaccinia virus proteome as a reference orthopox vaccine. All viral gene clones were verified by sequencing and purified recombinant proteins were used to construct the microarray. Serum IgG of cynomolgus macaques that recovered from monkeypox recognized at least 23 separate proteins within the orthopox proteome, while only 14 of these proteins were recognized by IgG from vaccinated humans. There were 12 of 14 antigens detected by sera of human vaccinees that were also recognized by IgG from convalescent macaques. The greatest level of IgG binding for macaques occurred with the structural proteins F13L and A33R, and the membrane scaffold protein D13L. Significant IgM responses directed towards A44R, F13L and A33R of monkeypox virus were detected before onset of clinical symptoms in macaques. Thus, antibodies from vaccination recognized a small number of proteins shared with pathogenic virus strains, while recovery from infection also involved humoral responses to antigens uniquely recognized within the monkeypox virus proteome.	11	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0015547	Keasey S, Pugh C, Tikhonov A, Chen G, Schweitzer B, Nalca A, Ulrich RG.

21389129	A novel respiratory model of infection with monkeypox virus in cynomolgus macaques	"Variola, the causative agent of smallpox, and the related monkeypox virus are both select agents that, if purposefully released, would cause public panic and social disruption. For this reason research continues in the areas of animal model and therapeutic development. Orthopoxviruses show a widely varying degree of host specificity, making development of accurate animal models difficult. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel respiratory infection technique that resulted in ""classic"" orthopox disease in nonhuman primates and takes the field of research one step closer to a better animal model."	27	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.02525-10	Goff AJ, Chapman J, Foster C, Wlazlowski C, Shamblin J, Lin K, Kreiselmeier N, Mucker E, Paragas J, Lawler J, Hensley L.

33992710	New methylene blue derivatives suggest novel anti-orthopoxviral strategies	Decades after the eradication of smallpox and the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination, over half of the world's population is immunologically naïve to variola virus and other orthopoxviruses (OPXVs). Even in those previously vaccinated against smallpox, protective immunity wanes over time. As such, there is a concomitant increase in the incidence of human OPXV infections worldwide. To identify novel antiviral compounds with potent anti-OPXV potential, we characterized the inhibitory activity of PAV-866 and other methylene blue derivatives against the prototypic poxvirus, vaccinia virus (VACV). These compounds inactivated virions prior to infection and consequently inhibited viral binding, fusion and entry. The compounds exhibited strong virucidal activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations, and inhibited VACV infection when added before, during or after viral adsorption. The compounds were effective against other OPXVs including monkeypox virus, cowpox virus and the newly identified Akhmeta virus. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel mode of inhibition that has not previously been demonstrated for small molecule compounds against VACV. Additional studies are in progress to determine the in vivo efficacy of these compounds against OPXVs and further characterize the anti-viral effects of these derivatives.	1	Information Unavailable	Antiviral; Methylene blue; Novel inhibitor; PAV-866; Poxviruses; Vaccinia virus	10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105086	Priyamvada L, Burgado J, Baker-Wagner M, Kitaygorodskyy A, Olson V, Lingappa VR, Satheshkumar PS.

16888017	Subunit recombinant vaccine protects against monkeypox	The smallpox vaccine Dryvax, a live vaccinia virus (VACV), protects against smallpox and monkeypox, but is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals. Because Abs to VACV mediate protection, a live virus vaccine could be substituted by a safe subunit protein-based vaccine able to induce a protective Ab response. We immunized rhesus macaques with plasmid DNA encoding the monkeypox orthologs of the VACV L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R proteins by the intradermal and i.m. routes, either alone or in combination with the equivalent recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli. Animals that received only DNA failed to produce high titer Abs, developed innumerable skin lesions after challenge, and died in a manner similar to placebo controls. By contrast, the animals vaccinated with proteins developed moderate to severe disease (20-155 skin lesions) but survived. Importantly, those immunized with DNA and boosted with proteins had mild disease with 15 or fewer lesions that resolved within days. DNA/protein immunization elicited Th responses and binding Ab titers to all four proteins that correlated negatively with the total lesion number. The sera of the immunized macaques recognized a limited number of linear B cell epitopes that are highly conserved among orthopoxviruses. Their identification may guide future efforts to develop simpler, safer, and more effective vaccines for monkeypox and smallpox.	54	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4049/jimmunol.177.4.2552	Heraud JM, Edghill-Smith Y, Ayala V, Kalisz I, Parrino J, Kalyanaraman VS, Manischewitz J, King LR, Hryniewicz A, Trindade CJ, Hassett M, Tsai WP, Venzon D, Nalca A, Vaccari M, Silvera P, Bray M, Graham BS, Golding H, Hooper JW, Franchini G.

16186219	A tale of two clades: monkeypox viruses	Human monkeypox was first recognized outside Africa in 2003 during an outbreak in the USA that was traced to imported monkeypox virus (MPXV)-infected West African rodents. Unlike the smallpox-like disease described in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; a Congo Basin country), disease in the USA appeared milder. Here, analyses compared clinical, laboratory and epidemiological features of confirmed human monkeypox case-patients, using data from outbreaks in the USA and the Congo Basin, and the results suggested that human disease pathogenicity was associated with the viral strain. Genomic sequencing of USA, Western and Central African MPXV isolates confirmed the existence of two MPXV clades. A comparison of open reading frames between MPXV clades permitted prediction of viral proteins that could cause the observed differences in human pathogenicity between these two clades. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis and clinical and epidemiological properties of MPXV can improve monkeypox prevention and control.	103	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/vir.0.81215-0	Likos AM, Sammons SA, Olson VA, Frace AM, Li Y, Olsen-Rasmussen M, Davidson W, Galloway R, Khristova ML, Reynolds MG, Zhao H, Carroll DS, Curns A, Formenty P, Esposito JJ, Regnery RL, Damon IK.

23400570	Detection of human monkeypox in the Republic of the Congo following intensive community education	Monkeypox is an acute viral infection with a clinical course resembling smallpox. It is endemic in northern and central Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but it is reported only sporadically in neighboring Republic of the Congo (ROC). In October 2009, interethnic violence in northwestern DRC precipitated the movement of refugees across the Ubangi River into ROC. The influx of refugees into ROC heightened concerns about monkeypox in the area, because of the possibility that the virus could be imported, or that incidence could increase caused by food insecurity and over reliance on bush meat. As part of a broad-based campaign to improve health standards in refugee settlement areas, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) sponsored a program of intensive community education that included modules on monkeypox recognition and prevention. In the 6 months immediately following the outreach, 10 suspected cases of monkeypox were reported to health authorities. Laboratory testing confirmed monkeypox virus infection in two individuals, one of whom was part of a cluster of four suspected cases identified retrospectively. Anecdotes collected at the time of case reporting suggest that the outreach campaign contributed to detection of suspected cases of monkeypox.	15	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.12-0758	Reynolds MG, Emerson GL, Pukuta E, Karhemere S, Muyembe JJ, Bikindou A, McCollum AM, Moses C, Wilkins K, Zhao H, Damon IK, Karem KL, Li Y, Carroll DS, Mombouli JV.

15829191	Experimental infection of prairie dogs with monkeypox virus	Studies of experimental infection of prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) with monkeypox virus are described. After intraperitoneal infection, all of the animals died within 11 days. Virus was cultured from their blood and oropharynx several days before death; at necropsy, most of the organs tested contained monkeypox virus. Marked hepatic and splenic necrosis were observed, along with mild inflammatory changes in the lungs. After intranasal (IN) infection, the primary pathologic changes were in the lungs and pleural cavity. Some of the IN infected animals (40%) survived, and monkeypox virus could be cultured from their nasal discharge and oropharynx for <22 days. Ulcerative lesions also developed on the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa of the surviving animals. Our findings support an earlier report, which suggested that infected prairie dogs can transmit monkeypox virus by respiratory and mucocutaneous contact with susceptible animals and persons.	25	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1104.040907	Xiao SY, Sbrana E, Watts DM, Siirin M, da Rosa AP, Tesh RB.

4340222	Outbreaks of monkeypox and serological surveys in nonhuman primates	In connexion with the recent detection of cases of monkeypox in man in West and Central Africa, the frequency of monkeypox outbreaks in monkeys since 1958, when the disease was first recognized in captive animals, has been investigated. Special incidence surveys were made for this purpose. During the last 3 years, a serological survey has been conducted to find natural foci of monkeypox virus, and a total of 2 242 sera from monkeys of different species from various parts of Africa and Asia have been examined for poxvirus antibodies. The survey failed to detect any significant indication of poxvirus infections. The observations suggest that although a few human cases of monkeypox have been identified, monkeypox in the natural environment is not widespread and is perhaps localized in small areas.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Arita I, Gispen R, Kalter SS, Wah LT, Marennikova SS, Netter R, Tagaya I.

15714414	Evaluation of human-to-human transmission of monkeypox from infected patients to health care workers	Background: In 2003, human monkeypox was first identified in the United States. The outbreak was associated with exposure to infected prairie dogs, but the potential for person-to-person transmission was a concern. This study examines health care worker (HCW) exposure to 3 patients with confirmed monkeypox. Methods: Exposed HCWs, defined as HCWs who entered a 2-m radius surrounding case patients with confirmed monkeypox, were identified by infection-control practitioners. A self-administered questionnaire and analysis of paired serum specimens determined exposure status, immune response, and postexposure signs and symptoms of monkeypox. Results: Of 81 exposed HCWs, 57 (70%) participated in the study. Among 57 participants, 40 (70%) had > or =1 unprotected exposure; none reported signs or symptoms consistent with monkeypox illness. One exposed HCW (2%), who had been vaccinated for smallpox within the past year, had serological evidence of recent orthopoxvirus infection; acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens tested positive for anti-orthopoxvirus IgM. No exposed HCWs had signs and symptoms consistent with monkeypox. Conclusion: More than three-quarters of exposed HCWs reported at least 1 unprotected encounter with a patient who had monkeypox. One asymptomatic HCW showed laboratory evidence of recent orthopoxvirus infection, which was possibly attributable to either recent infection or smallpox vaccination. Transmission of monkeypox likely is a rare event in the health care setting.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1086/427805	Fleischauer AT, Kile JC, Davidson M, Fischer M, Karem KL, Teclaw R, Messersmith H, Pontones P, Beard BA, Braden ZH, Cono J, Sejvar JJ, Khan AS, Damon I, Kuehnert MJ.

19889227	Inhibition of monkeypox virus replication by RNA interference	The Orthopoxvirus genus of Poxviridae family is comprised of several human pathogens, including cowpox (CPXV), Vaccinia (VACV), monkeypox (MPV) and Variola (VARV) viruses. Species of this virus genus cause human diseases with various severities and outcome ranging from mild conditions to death in fulminating cases. Currently, vaccination is the only protective measure against infection with these viruses and no licensed antiviral drug therapy is available. In this study, we investigated the potential of RNA interference pathway (RNAi) as a therapeutic approach for orthopox virus infections using MPV as a model. Based on genome-wide expression studies and bioinformatic analysis, we selected 12 viral genes and targeted them by small interference RNA (siRNA). Forty-eight siRNA constructs were developed and evaluated in vitro for their ability to inhibit viral replication. Two genes, each targeted with four different siRNA constructs in one pool, were limiting to viral replication. Seven siRNA constructs from these two pools, targeting either an essential gene for viral replication (A6R) or an important gene in viral entry (E8L), inhibited viral replication in cell culture by 65-95% with no apparent cytotoxicity. Further analysis with wild-type and recombinant MPV expressing green fluorescence protein demonstrated that one of these constructs, siA6-a, was the most potent and inhibited viral replication for up to 7 days at a concentration of 10 nM. These results emphasis the essential role of A6R gene in viral replication, and demonstrate the potential of RNAi as a therapeutic approach for developing oligonucleotide-based drug therapy for MPV and other orthopox viruses.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-6-188	Alkhalil A, Strand S, Mucker E, Huggins JW, Jahrling PB, Ibrahim SM.

2841783	Human monkeypox: disease pattern, incidence and attack rates in a rural area of northern Zaire	Human monkeypox is a zoonosis that occurs sporadically in the tropical rainforest of western and central Africa. This article presents the results of epidemiological features of 91 monkeypox patients reported in Bumba zone in northern Zaire during the period 1981 to 1985. Their age ranged from 7 months to 29 years (93% below 15 years of age). 11% of patients had visible smallpox vaccination scars. Deaths occurred sporadically; the overall case-fatality rate was 9%. 91 patients arose in 61 separate outbreaks; 42 of them consisted of only a single case. The source of infection was suspected to be animal for 70 cases, and human for the remaining 21 cases. The illness occurred in all months of the year. There was a considerable clustering of cases in the northern part of the zone. The average annual incidence rate in the observed zone was 0.63 cases per 10,000 population with marked differences in age, time and place. The average annual primary attack rate among unvaccinated individuals (1.7/10,000) sharply contrasted with those vaccinated (0.04/10,000). The secondary attack rate for contacts without vaccination scar (4.3%) differed significantly from those who had been vaccinated in past (0.7%). Many unvaccinated contacts living under conditions of maximal exposure to index cases escaped not only the disease but also infection. The low incidence rate of human monkeypox indicates its limited public health importance even in a well-known enzootic area.	19	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Grab B, Paluku KM, Szczeniowski MV.

25944444	Using the Ground Squirrel (Marmota bobak) as an Animal Model to Assess Monkeypox Drug Efficacy	In experiments to study the sensitivity of ground squirrels (Marmota bobak) to monkeypox virus (MPXV) at intranasal challenge, expressed pox-like clinical symptoms (hyperthermia, lymphadenitis, skin rash all over the body and mucous membranes and others) were observed 7-9 days post-infection. The 50% infective dose (ID50 ) of MPXV for these marmots determined by the presence of clinical signs of the disease was 2.2 log10 PFU. Some diseased marmots (about 40%) died 13-22 days post-infection, and the mortality rate was weakly dependent on MPXV infective dose. Lungs with trachea were primary target organs of marmots challenged intranasally (with ~30 ID50 ). The pathogen got to secondary target organs of the animals mainly via the lymphatic way (with replication in bifurcation lymph nodes). Lungs with trachea, nasal mucosa and skin were the organs where the maximum MPXV amounts accumulated in these animals. Evidences of the pathogen presence and replication were revealed in these and subcutaneously infected marmots in the traditional primary target cells for MPXV (macrophages and respiratory tract epitheliocytes), as well as in some other cells (endotheliocytes, plasmocytes, fibroblasts, reticular and smooth muscle cells). Our use of this animal species to assess the antiviral efficacy of some drugs demonstrated the agreement of the obtained results with those described in scientific literature, which opens up the prospects of using marmots as animal models for monkeypox to develop therapeutic and preventive anti-smallpox drugs.	4	Information Unavailable	Marmota bobak; animal model; anti-monkeypox efficacy; drug; ground squirrel; intranasal challenge; monkeypox virus	10.1111/tbed.12364	Sergeev AA, Kabanov AS, Bulychev LE, Sergeev AA, Pyankov OV, Bodnev SA, Galahova DO, Zamedyanskaya AS, Titova KA, Glotova TI, Taranov OS, Omigov VV, Shishkina LN, Agafonov AP, Sergeev AN.

26246580	Evasion of the Innate Immune Type I Interferon System by Monkeypox Virus	The vaccinia virus (VACV) E3 protein has been shown to be important for blocking activation of the cellular innate immune system and allowing viral replication to occur unhindered. Mutation or deletion of E3L severely affects viral host range and pathogenesis. While the monkeypox virus (MPXV) genome encodes a homologue of the VACV E3 protein, encoded by the F3L gene, the MPXV gene is predicted to encode a protein with a truncation of 37 N-terminal amino acids. VACV with a genome encoding a similarly truncated E3L protein (VACV-E3LΔ37N) has been shown to be attenuated in mouse models, and infection with VACV-E3LΔ37N has been shown to lead to activation of the host antiviral protein kinase R pathway. In this report, we present data demonstrating that, despite containing a truncated E3 homologue, MPXV phenotypically resembles a wild-type (wt) VACV rather than VACV-E3LΔ37N. Thus, MPXV appears to contain a gene or genes that can suppress the phenotypes associated with an N-terminal truncation in E3. The suppression maps to sequences outside F3L, suggesting that the suppression is extragenic in nature. Thus, MPXV appears to have evolved mechanisms to minimize the effects of partial inactivation of its E3 homologue. Importance: Poxviruses have evolved to have many mechanisms to evade host antiviral innate immunity; these mechanisms may allow these viruses to cause disease. Within the family of poxviruses, variola virus (which causes smallpox) is the most pathogenic, while monkeypox virus is intermediate in pathogenicity between vaccinia virus and variola virus. Understanding the mechanisms of monkeypox virus innate immune evasion will help us to understand the evolution of poxvirus innate immune evasion capabilities, providing a better understanding of how poxviruses cause disease.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00304-15	Arndt WD, Cotsmire S, Trainor K, Harrington H, Hauns K, Kibler KV, Huynh TP, Jacobs BL.

19075062	In vitro efficacy of ST246 against smallpox and monkeypox	Since the eradication of smallpox and the cessation of routine childhood vaccination for smallpox, the proportion of the world's population susceptible to infection with orthopoxviruses, such as variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) and monkeypox virus, has grown substantially. In the United States, the only vaccines for smallpox licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been live virus vaccines. Unfortunately, a substantial number of people cannot receive live virus vaccines due to contraindications. Furthermore, no antiviral drugs have been fully approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of orthopoxvirus infection. Here, we show the inhibitory effect of one new antiviral compound, ST-246, on the in vitro growth properties of six variola virus strains and seven monkeypox virus strains. We performed multiple assays to monitor the cytopathic effect and to evaluate the reduction of viral progeny production and release in the presence of the compound. ST-246 had 50% effective concentrations of <or=0.067 microM against variola virus and <0.04 microM against monkeypox virus. In a dose-dependent manner, plaque size and comet tail formation were markedly reduced in the presence of the drug at low, noncytotoxic concentrations between 0.015 and 0.05 microM. Our in vitro phenotype data suggest that ST-246 inhibits variola and monkeypox viruses similarly by reducing the production and release of enveloped orthopoxvirus and support the development of ST-246 as an antiviral therapeutic compound for the treatment of severe systemic orthopoxvirus infections.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.01044-08	Smith SK, Olson VA, Karem KL, Jordan R, Hruby DE, Damon IK.

21814864	Infection of cynomolgus macaques with a recombinant monkeypox virus encoding green fluorescent protein	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) causes a vesiculopustular rash illness resembling smallpox in humans and produces a similar disease in nonhuman primates. To enhance the ability of researchers to study experimental MPXV infections, we inserted a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) into Monkeypox virus Zaire-79. Wild-type and MPXV-GFP replicated with similar kinetics in cell culture and caused a similar disease when injected intravenously into cynomolgus macaques. In MPXV-GFP-infected animals, examination under fluorescent light facilitated the identification of skin lesions during disease development and internal sites of replication at necropsy. MPXV-GFP could improve the quantitative assessment of antiviral therapy and vaccine efficacy.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1007/s00705-011-1065-1	Goff A, Mucker E, Raymond J, Fisher R, Bray M, Hensley L, Paragas J.

19668372	Comparison of monkeypox viruses pathogenesis in mice by in vivo imaging	Monkeypox viruses (MPXV) cause human monkeypox, a zoonotic smallpox-like disease endemic to Africa, and are of worldwide public health and biodefense concern. Using viruses from the Congo (MPXV-2003-Congo-358) and West African (MPXV-2003-USA-044) clades, we constructed recombinant viruses that express the luciferase gene (MPXV-Congo/Luc+and MPXV-USA-Luc+) and compared their viral infection in mice by biophotonic imaging. BALB/c mice became infected by both MPXV clades, but they recovered and cleared the infection within 10 days post-infection (PI). However, infection in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) BALB/c mice resulted in 100% lethality. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of both MPXV-Congo and MPXV-Congo/Luc+resulted in a systemic clinical disease and the same mean time-to-death at 9 (+/-0) days post-infection. Likewise, IP injection of SCID-BALB/c mice with MPXV-USA or the MPXV-USA-Luc+, resulted in similar disease but longer (P<0.05) mean time-to-death (11+/-0 days) for both viruses compared to the Congo strains. Imaging studies in SCID mice showed luminescence in the abdomen within 24 hours PI with subsequent spread elsewhere. Animals infected with the MPXV-USA/Luc+had less intense luminescence in tissues than those inoculated with MPXV-Congo/Luc+, and systemic spread of the MPXV-USA/Luc+virus occurred approximately two days later than the MPXV-Congo/Luc+. The ovary was an important target for viral replication as evidenced by the high viral titers and immunohistochemistry. These studies demonstrate the suitability of a mouse model and biophotonic imaging to compare the disease progression and tissue tropism of MPX viruses.	26	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0006592	Osorio JE, Iams KP, Meteyer CU, Rocke TE.

26013374	Introduction of Monkeypox into a Community and Household: Risk Factors and Zoonotic Reservoirs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	An increased incidence of monkeypox (MPX) infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was noted by the regional surveillance system in October 2013. Little information exists regarding how MPX is introduced into the community and the factors associated with transmission within the household. Sixty-eight wild animals were collected and tested for Orthopoxvirus. Two of three rope squirrels (Funisciurus sp.) were positive for antibodies to Orthopoxviruses; however, no increased risk was associated with the consumption or preparation of rope squirrels. A retrospective cohort investigation and a case-control investigation were performed to identify risk factors affecting the introduction of monkeypox virus (MPXV) into the community and transmission within the home. School-age males were the individuals most frequently identified as the first person infected in the household and were the group most frequently affected overall. Risk factors of acquiring MPXV in a household included sleeping in the same room or bed, or using the same plate or cup as the primary case. There was no significant risk associated with eating or processing of wild animals. Activities associated with an increased risk of MPXV transmission all have potential for virus exposure to the mucosa.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.15-0168	Nolen LD, Osadebe L, Katomba J, Likofata J, Mukadi D, Monroe B, Doty J, Kalemba L, Malekani J, Kabamba J, Bomponda PL, Lokota JI, Balilo MP, Likafi T, Lushima RS, Tamfum JJ, Okitolonda EW, McCollum AM, Reynolds MG.

29410823	Ghosts of infections past: using archival samples to understand a century of monkeypox virus prevalence among host communities across space and time	Infectious diseases that originate from multiple wildlife hosts can be complex and problematic to manage. A full understanding is further limited by large temporal and spatial gaps in sampling. However, these limitations can be overcome, in part, by using historical samples, such as those derived from museum collections. Here, we screened over 1000 museum specimens collected over the past 120 years to examine the historical distribution and prevalence of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in five species of African rope squirrel (Funisciurus sp.) collected across Central Africa. We found evidence of MPXV infections in host species as early as 1899, half a century earlier than the first recognized case of MPXV in 1958, supporting the suggestion that historic pox-like outbreaks in humans and non-human primates may have been caused by MPXV rather than smallpox as originally thought. MPX viral DNA was found in 93 of 1038 (9.0%) specimens from five Funisciurus species (F. anerythrus, F. carruthersi, F. congicus, F. lemniscatus and F. pyrropus), of which F. carruthersi and pyrropus had not previously been identified as potential MPXV hosts. We additionally documented relative prevalence rates of infection in museum specimens of Funisciurus and examined the spatial and temporal distribution of MPXV in these potential host species across nearly a hundred years (1899-1993).	5	Information Unavailable	Funisciurus; ancient DNA; host community; monkeypox; museum specimens; zoonotic diseases	10.1098/rsos.171089	Tiee MS, Harrigan RJ, Thomassen HA, Smith TB.

26147658	Susceptibility of Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to Monkeypox Virus: A Low Dose Prospective Model for Monkeypox and Smallpox Disease	Although current nonhuman primate models of monkeypox and smallpox diseases provide some insight into disease pathogenesis, they require a high titer inoculum, use an unnatural route of infection, and/or do not accurately represent the entire disease course. This is a concern when developing smallpox and/or monkeypox countermeasures or trying to understand host pathogen relationships. In our studies, we altered half of the test system by using a New World nonhuman primate host, the common marmoset. Based on dose finding studies, we found that marmosets are susceptible to monkeypox virus infection, produce a high viremia, and have pathological features consistent with smallpox and monkeypox in humans. The low dose (48 plaque forming units) required to elicit a uniformly lethal disease and the extended incubation (preclinical signs) are unique features among nonhuman primate models utilizing monkeypox virus. The uniform lethality, hemorrhagic rash, high viremia, decrease in platelets, pathology, and abbreviated acute phase are reflective of early-type hemorrhagic smallpox.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0131742	Mucker EM, Chapman J, Huzella LM, Huggins JW, Shamblin J, Robinson CG, Hensley LE.

24779460	Evaluation of monkeypox virus infection of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) using in vivo bioluminescent imaging	Monkeypox (MPX) is a re-emerging zoonotic disease that is endemic in Central and West Africa, where it can cause a smallpox-like disease in humans. Despite many epidemiologic and field investigations of MPX, no definitive reservoir species has been identified. Using recombinant viruses expressing the firefly luciferase (luc) gene, we previously demonstrated the suitability of in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to study the pathogenesis of MPX in animal models. Here, we evaluated BLI as a novel approach for tracking MPX virus infection in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs were affected during a multistate outbreak of MPX in the US in 2003 and have since been used as an animal model of this disease. Our BLI results were compared with PCR and virus isolation from tissues collected postmortem. Virus was easily detected and quantified in skin and superficial tissues by BLI before and during clinical phases, as well as in subclinical secondary cases, but was not reliably detected in deep tissues such as the lung. Although there are limitations to viral detection in larger wild rodent species, BLI can enhance the use of prairie dogs as an animal model of MPX and can be used for the study of infection, disease progression, and transmission in potential wild rodent reservoirs.	13	Information Unavailable	Bioluminescence; Monkeypox virus; Orthopoxvirus; black-tailed prairie dog; histopathology; in vivo imaging; poxvirus; real-time PCR	10.7589/2013-07-171	Falendysz EA, Londoño-Navas AM, Meteyer CU, Pussini N, Lopera JG, Osorio JE, Rocke TE.

16103616	Extended interhuman transmission of monkeypox in a hospital community in the Republic of the Congo, 2003	This report describes the first reported outbreak of human monkeypox in the Republic of Congo. Eleven confirmed and probable monkeypox cases were observed during this outbreak, all were less than 18 years old, and most resided on the grounds of the Government Hospital in Impfondo. Molecular, virologic, and serologic, and diagnostic assays were used to detect evidence of monkeypox (or orthopox) virus infection in individuals with striking dermatologic and other clinical manifestations. The majority of cases in this outbreak experienced significant, symptomatic illnesses; there was one death, possibly involving secondary complications, and one instance of profound sequelae. Up to six sequential transmissions of monkeypox virus from person to person are hypothesized to have occurred, making this the longest uninterrupted chain of human monkeypox fully documented to date. The pattern of sustained human-to-human transmission observed during this outbreak may influence our current perception of the capacity for this zoonotic virus to adapt to humans.	62	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Learned LA, Reynolds MG, Wassa DW, Li Y, Olson VA, Karem K, Stempora LL, Braden ZH, Kline R, Likos A, Libama F, Moudzeo H, Bolanda JD, Tarangonia P, Boumandoki P, Formenty P, Harvey JM, Damon IK.

26517839	Further Assessment of Monkeypox Virus Infection in Gambian Pouched Rats (Cricetomys gambianus) Using In Vivo Bioluminescent Imaging	Monkeypox is a zoonosis clinically similar to smallpox in humans. Recent evidence has shown a potential risk of increased incidence in central Africa. Despite attempts to isolate the virus from wild rodents and other small mammals, no reservoir host has been identified. In 2003, Monkeypox virus (MPXV) was accidentally introduced into the U.S. via the pet trade and was associated with the Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus). Therefore, we investigated the potential reservoir competence of the Gambian pouched rat for MPXV by utilizing a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods. We inoculated three animals by the intradermal route and three animals by the intranasal route, with one mock-infected control for each route. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was used to track replicating virus in infected animals and virological assays (e.g. real time PCR, cell culture) were used to determine viral load in blood, urine, ocular, nasal, oral, and rectal swabs. Intradermal inoculation resulted in clinical signs of monkeypox infection in two of three animals. One severely ill animal was euthanized and the other affected animal recovered. In contrast, intranasal inoculation resulted in subclinical infection in all three animals. All animals, regardless of apparent or inapparent infection, shed virus in oral and nasal secretions. Additionally, BLI identified viral replication in the skin without grossly visible lesions. These results suggest that Gambian pouched rats may play an important role in transmission of the virus to humans, as they are hunted for consumption and it is possible for MPXV-infected pouched rats to shed infectious virus without displaying overt clinical signs.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0004130	Falendysz EA, Lopera JG, Lorenzsonn F, Salzer JS, Hutson CL, Doty J, Gallardo-Romero N, Carroll DS, Osorio JE, Rocke TE.

8207396	Evidence for recent genetic variation in monkeypox viruses	DNA from isolates of monkeypox virus, when digested with the endonuclease PstI, gave fragment-size profiles which correlated with the geographic area from which the isolate originated. Although some of the differences were located subterminally in the genome, others mapped to the central conserved region. Further differentiation of the viral genomes was sought by analysis of a short region within the central conserved part of the genome that appeared to be a partially deleted counterpart of an intact 1024 bp open reading frame (ORF) present in variola and vaccinia virus genomes. We reasoned that this region would not be conserved by functional selection and would therefore be likely to show more variation between isolates of monkeypox virus. The deletions found in monkeypox virus isolates from Liberia and from Benin were almost the same as that which we had previously found in the Denmark strain. A much shortened ORF, potentially coding for a product of 133 amino acids, was retained in all three West African isolates, but three Zairean isolates each showed an identical series of small insertions and deletions which effectively abolish the ORF. Three deletions, present in all isolates, must pre-date the geographical separation of monkeypox virus lineages; other, presumably more recent, changes differ between the Zairean and West African isolates. In contrast, the base similarity was found to be more than 99% when all the monkeypox virus sequences were appropriately aligned. This, in a disrupted and presumably nonfunctional gene also indicates that the changes described are recent. It is suggested that insertions and deletions occur regularly during poxvirus DNA replication, but are preserved only in sequences that are not required for continued transmission in the natural host.	6	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-75-6-1303	Douglass NJ, Richardson M, Dumbell KR.

35393265	Efficient assembly of a large fragment of monkeypox virus genome as a qPCR template using dual-selection based transformation-associated recombination	Transformation-associated recombination (TAR) has been widely used to assemble large DNA constructs. One of the significant obstacles hindering assembly efficiency is the presence of error-prone DNA repair pathways in yeast, which results in vector backbone recircularization or illegitimate recombination products. To increase TAR assembly efficiency, we prepared a dual-selective TAR vector, pGFCS, by adding a PADH1-URA3 cassette to a previously described yeast-bacteria shuttle vector, pGF, harboring a PHIS3-HIS3 cassette as a positive selection marker. This new cassette works as a negative selection marker to ensure that yeast harboring a recircularized vector cannot propagate in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid. To prevent pGFCS bearing ura3 from recombining with endogenous ura3-52 in the yeast genome, a highly transformable Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, VL6-48B, was prepared by chromosomal substitution of ura3-52 with a transgene conferring resistance to blasticidin. A 55-kb genomic fragment of monkeypox virus encompassing primary detection targets for quantitative PCR was assembled by TAR using pGFCS in VL6-48B. The pGFCS-mediated TAR assembly showed a zero rate of vector recircularization and an average correct assembly yield of 79% indicating that the dual-selection strategy provides an efficient approach to optimizing TAR assembly.

22738820	Effects of georeferencing effort on mapping monkeypox case distributions and transmission risk	Background: Maps of disease occurrences and GIS-based models of disease transmission risk are increasingly common, and both rely on georeferenced diseases data. Automated methods for georeferencing disease data have been widely studied for developed countries with rich sources of geographic referenced data. However, the transferability of these methods to countries without comparable geographic reference data, particularly when working with historical disease data, has not been as widely studied. Historically, precise geographic information about where individual cases occur has been collected and stored verbally, identifying specific locations using place names. Georeferencing historic data is challenging however, because it is difficult to find appropriate geographic reference data to match the place names to. Here, we assess the degree of care and research invested in converting textual descriptions of disease occurrence locations to numerical grid coordinates (latitude and longitude). Specifically, we develop three datasets from the same, original monkeypox disease occurrence data, with varying levels of care and effort: the first based on an automated web-service, the second improving on the first by reference to additional maps and digital gazetteers, and the third improving still more based on extensive consultation of legacy surveillance records that provided considerable additional information about each case. To illustrate the implications of these seemingly subtle improvements in data quality, we develop ecological niche models and predictive maps of monkeypox transmission risk based on each of the three occurrence data sets. Results: We found macrogeographic variations in ecological niche models depending on the type of georeferencing method used. Less-careful georeferencing identified much smaller areas as having potential for monkeypox transmission in the Sahel region, as well as around the rim of the Congo Basin. These results have implications for mapping efforts, as each higher level of georeferencing precision required considerably greater time investment. Conclusions: The importance of careful georeferencing cannot be overlooked, despite it being a time- and labor-intensive process. Investment in archival storage of primary disease-occurrence data is merited, and improved digital gazetteers are needed to support public health mapping activities, particularly in developing countries, where maps and geographic information may be sparse.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1476-072X-11-23	Lash RR, Carroll DS, Hughes CM, Nakazawa Y, Karem K, Damon IK, Peterson AT.

17910420	Substrate specificity of homogeneous monkeypox virus uracil-DNA glycosylase	Weak or nonexistent smallpox immunity in today's human population raises concerns about the possibility of natural or provoked genetic modifications leading to re-emergence of variola virus and other poxviruses. Thus, the development of new antiviral strategies aimed at poxvirus infections in humans is a high priority. The DNA repair protein uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) is one of the viral enzymes important for poxvirus pathogenesis. Consequently, the inhibition of UNG is a rational therapeutic strategy for infections with poxviruses. Monkeypox virus, which occurs naturally in Africa, can cause a smallpox-like disease in humans. Here, the monkeypox virus UNG (mpUNG) is characterized and compared to vaccinia virus UNG (vUNG) and human UNG (hUNG). The mpUNG protein excises uracil preferentially from single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, mpUNG prefers the U.G pair over the U.A pair and does not excise oxidized bases. Both mpUNG and vUNG viral proteins are strongly inhibited by physiological concentrations of NaCl and MgCl2. Although the two viral DNA repair enzymes have similar substrate specificities, the kcat/KM values of mpUNG are higher than those of vUNG. The mpUNG protein was strongly inhibited by 5-azauracil and to a lesser extent by 4(6)-aminouracil and 5-halogenated uracil analogues, whereas uracil had no effect. To develop antiviral drugs toward mpUNG, we also validated a repair assay using the molecular beacons containing multiple uracil residues. Potential targets and strategies for combating pathogenic orthopoxviruses, including smallpox, are discussed.	6	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1021/bi700726a	Duraffour S, Ishchenko AA, Saparbaev M, Crance JM, Garin D.

2850277	The transmission potential of monkeypox virus in human populations	Data on monkeypox in Zaire over the five years 1980-1984 are analysed to assess the protection imparted by past smallpox vaccination and the transmission potential of the virus in unvaccinated communities. Attack rates in individuals with and without vaccination scars indicated that smallpox vaccination (discontinued in 1980) imparted approximately 85% protection against monkeypox. It is predicted that monkeypox virus will continue to be introduced into human communities from animal sources, and that the average magnitude and duration of monkeypox epidemics will increase as vaccine-derived protection declines in the population. On the other hand, current evidence indicates that the virus is appreciably less transmissible than was smallpox, and that it will not persist in human communities, even in the total absence of vaccination. The findings thus support the recommendation of the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication to cease routine smallpox vaccination in monkeypox endemic areas, but to encourage continued epidemiological surveillance.	37	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/ije/17.3.643	Fine PE, Jezek Z, Grab B, Dixon H.

17953084	Occupational risks during a monkeypox outbreak, Wisconsin, 2003	We determined factors associated with occupational transmission in Wisconsin during the 2003 outbreak of prairie dog--associated monkeypox virus infections. Our investigation included active contact surveillance, exposure-related interviews, and a veterinary facility cohort study. We identified 19 confirmed, 5 probable, and 3 suspected cases. Rash, headache, sweats, and fever were reported by > 80% of patients. Occupationally transmitted infections occurred in 12 veterinary staff, 2 pet store employees, and 2 animal distributors. The following were associated with illness: working directly with animal care (p = 0.002), being involved in prairie dog examination, caring for an animal within 6 feet of an ill prairie dog (p = 0.03), feeding an ill prairie dog (p = 0.002), and using an antihistamine (p = 0.04). Having never handled an ill prairie dog (p = 0.004) was protective. Veterinary staff used personal protective equipment sporadically. Our findings underscore the importance of standard veterinary infection-control guidelines.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1308.061365	Croft DR, Sotir MJ, Williams CJ, Kazmierczak JJ, Wegner MV, Rausch D, Graham MB, Foldy SL, Wolters M, Damon IK, Karem KL, Davis JP.

16941343	Clinical manifestations of human monkeypox influenced by route of infection	"Background: In April 2003, an outbreak of monkeypox occurred in the United States following the importation of monkeypox virus (MPXV)-infected animals in a consignment of exotic pets from West Africa. Transmission of the virus to non-African captive species, including prairie dogs, preceded human disease. Methods: We evaluated the influence of the route of infection on clinical illness for persons with confirmed and probable cases of human monkeypox. Exposures were categorized as being ""noninvasive"" (e.g., the person touched an infected animal, cleaned an infected animal's cage, and/or stood within 6 feet of an infected animal) or ""complex"" (e.g., invasive bite or scratch from an ill prairie dog plus potential noninvasive exposure), and associations between exposure, illness manifestation, and illness progression (i.e., elapsed time from first exposure to an ill prairie dog through various benchmarks of illness) were assessed. Results: Patients with complex exposures were more likely than patients with noninvasive exposures to have experienced pronounced signs of systemic illness (49.1% vs. 16.7%; P=.041) and to have been hospitalized during illness (68.8% vs. 10.3%; P<.001). Complex exposures were also associated with shorter incubation periods (9 days for complex exposures vs. 13 days for noninvasive exposures) and the absence of a distinct febrile prodrome. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that route of infection can influence monkeypox illness manifestations."	47	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1086/505880	Reynolds MG, Yorita KL, Kuehnert MJ, Davidson WB, Huhn GD, Holman RC, Damon IK.

28003603	A Single Vaccination of Nonhuman Primates with Highly Attenuated Smallpox Vaccine, LC16m8, Provides Long-term Protection against Monkeypox	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) causes human monkeypox (human MPX), which is a similar disease to smallpox in humans. A previous study showed that a single vaccination of monkeys with LC16m8, a highly attenuated smallpox vaccine, protected them from MPX from 4-5 weeks post-vaccination. In this study, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of a single vaccination with LC16m8 in a nonhuman primate model of MPXV infection. The monkeys were inoculated with either LC16m8, Lister (parental strain of LC16m8), or a mock-up vaccine, and then challenged with MPXV via a subcutaneous route, at 6 and 12 months after vaccination, which we compared with either Lister or the mock-up vaccination. The LC16m8 monkeys exhibited almost no MPX-associated symptoms, whereas most of the naïve monkeys died. LC16m8 generated the protective memory immune response against MPXV, as suggested by the immediate viremia reduction and the response of the IgG antibody. The results demonstrated that the vaccination of monkeys with a single dose of LC16m8 provided durable protection against MPXV for longer than one year after immunization. The results suggest that the vaccination of humans with LC16m8 could induce long-term protection against MPXV infection.	3	Information Unavailable	LC16m8; monkeypox; monkeypox virus; smallpox vaccine; vaccinia virus	10.7883/yoken.JJID.2016.417	Iizuka I, Ami Y, Suzaki Y, Nagata N, Fukushi S, Ogata M, Morikawa S, Hasegawa H, Mizuguchi M, Kurane I, Saijo M.

33168908	CRISPR/Cas9 as an antiviral against Orthopoxviruses using an AAV vector	A vaccine for smallpox is no longer administered to the general public, and there is no proven, safe treatment specific to poxvirus infections, leaving people susceptible to infections by smallpox and other zoonotic Orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox. Using vaccinia virus (VACV) as a model organism for other Orthopoxviruses, CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to target three essential genes that are conserved across the genus, including A17L, E3L, and I2L. Three individual single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed per gene to facilitate redundancy in rendering the genes inactive, thereby reducing the reproduction of the virus. The efficacy of the CRISPR targets was tested by transfecting human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells with plasmids encoding both SaCas9 and an individual sgRNA. This resulted in a reduction of VACV titer by up to 93.19% per target. Following the verification of CRISPR targets, safe and targeted delivery of the VACV CRISPR antivirals was tested using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a packaging vector for both SaCas9 and sgRNA. Similarly, AAV delivery of the CRISPR antivirals resulted in a reduction of viral titer by up to 92.97% for an individual target. Overall, we have identified highly specific CRISPR targets that significantly reduce VACV titer as well as an appropriate vector for delivering these CRISPR antiviral components to host cells in vitro.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/s41598-020-76449-9	Siegrist CM, Kinahan SM, Settecerri T, Greene AC, Santarpia JL.

23135728	Humoral immunity to smallpox vaccines and monkeypox virus challenge: proteomic assessment and clinical correlations	Despite the eradication of smallpox, orthopoxviruses (OPV) remain public health concerns. Efforts to develop new therapeutics and vaccines for smallpox continue through their evaluation in animal models despite limited understanding of the specific correlates of protective immunity. Recent monkeypox virus challenge studies have established the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) as a model of human systemic OPV infections. In this study, we assess the induction of humoral immunity in humans and prairie dogs receiving Dryvax, Acam2000, or Imvamune vaccine and characterize the proteomic profile of immune recognition using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), neutralization assays, and protein microarrays. We confirm anticipated similarities of antigenic protein targets of smallpox vaccine-induced responses in humans and prairie dogs and identify several differences. Subsequent monkeypox virus intranasal infection of vaccinated prairie dogs resulted in a significant boost in humoral immunity characterized by a shift in reactivity of increased intensity to a broader range of OPV proteins. This work provides evidence of similarities between the vaccine responses in prairie dogs and humans that enhance the value of the prairie dog model system as an OPV vaccination model and offers novel findings that form a framework for examining the humoral immune response induced by systemic orthopoxvirus infection.	11	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.02089-12	Townsend MB, Keckler MS, Patel N, Davies DH, Felgner P, Damon IK, Karem KL.

3002651	Can variola-like viruses be derived from monkeypox virus? An investigation based on DNA mapping	"The results are presented of a special study to determine whether variola-like ""whitepox"" viruses could arise as white pock variants of monkeypox virus after one or a few mutations. DNA mapping by cross-hybridization of restriction endonuclease DNA fragments was carried out on 18 orthopoxviruses relevant to this study, including variola and monkeypox viruses and white (non-haemorrhagic) pock producers recovered from chorioallantoic membranes infected with red (haemorrhagic) pock-producing monkeypox viruses. The distinctiveness of the DNA maps of true variola and monkeypox viruses indicated that spontaneous production of ""whitepox"" from monkeypox virus was genetically impossible. These and other observations led to the conclusion that the ""whitepox"" viruses recovered from monkeypox virus stocks had an exogenous origin."	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Esposito JJ, Nakano JH, Obijeski JF.

25791934	Genetic studies of the susceptibility of classical and wild-derived inbred mouse strains to monkeypox virus	Previously, we screened 38 inbred mouse strains for susceptibility to monkeypox virus (MPXV) and focused on wild-derived CAST mice because of their extreme vulnerability. Here, we provide further analysis of inbred mouse strains. NZW/Lac and C58 mice exhibited more weight loss than other classical inbred strains but all survived intranasal challenges with 10(4) to 10(6)PFU of MPXV. Mice from three wild derived strains, in addition to CAST, exhibited severe weight loss and died or were euthanized. LD50 values for CASA, MOLF and PERA were 100, 6800 and >10(5)PFU, respectively. CASA was inbred independently from the same founders as CAST, whereas MOLF and PERA are genetically and geographically distinct. The MPXV susceptibility of the F1 progeny of CAST and either C57BL/6 or BALB/c indicated that resistance is dominant. Back-crossing the F1 progeny of C57BL/6 and CAST to CAST suggested more than one independent resistant locus.	5	Information Unavailable	Pathogenesis; Poxvirus; Select agent; Virulence	10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.048	Earl PL, Americo JL, Moss B.

26486622	Zoonotic Poxviruses Associated with Companion Animals	Understanding the zoonotic risk posed by poxviruses in companion animals is important for protecting both human and animal health. The outbreak of monkeypox in the United States, as well as current reports of cowpox in Europe, point to the fact that companion animals are increasingly serving as sources of poxvirus transmission to people. In addition, the trend among hobbyists to keep livestock (such as goats) in urban and semi-urban areas has contributed to increased parapoxvirus exposures among people not traditionally considered at high risk. Despite the historic notoriety of poxviruses and the diseases they cause, poxvirus infections are often missed. Delays in diagnosing poxvirus-associated infections in companion animals can lead to inadvertent human exposures. Delays in confirming human infections can result in inappropriate treatment or prolonged recovery. Early recognition of poxvirus-associated infections and application of appropriate preventive measures can reduce the spread of virus between companion animals and their owners. This review will discuss the epidemiology and clinical features associated with the zoonotic poxvirus infections most commonly associated with companion animals.	4	Review	companion animals; cowpox; monkeypox; orf; orthopoxvirus; parapoxvirus; poxvirus; zoonoses	10.3390/ani1040377	Tack DM, Reynolds MG.

16698998	LC16m8, a highly attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine lacking expression of the membrane protein B5R, protects monkeys from monkeypox	The potential threat of smallpox as a bioweapon has led to the production and stockpiling of smallpox vaccine in some countries. Human monkeypox, a rare but important viral zoonosis endemic to central and western Africa, has recently emerged in the United States. Thus, even though smallpox has been eradicated, a vaccinia virus vaccine that can induce protective immunity against smallpox and monkeypox is still invaluable. The ability of the highly attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine strain LC16m8, with a mutation in the important immunogenic membrane protein B5R, to induce protective immunity against monkeypox in nonhuman primates was evaluated in comparison with the parental Lister strain. Monkeys were immunized with LC16m8 or Lister and then infected intranasally or subcutaneously with monkeypox virus strain Liberia or Zr-599, respectively. Immunized monkeys showed no symptoms of monkeypox in the intranasal-inoculation model, while nonimmunized controls showed typical symptoms. In the subcutaneous-inoculation model, monkeys immunized with LC16m8 showed no symptoms of monkeypox except for a mild ulcer at the site of monkeypox virus inoculation, and those immunized with Lister showed no symptoms of monkeypox, while nonimmunized controls showed lethal and typical symptoms. These results indicate that LC16m8 prevents lethal monkeypox in monkeys, and they suggest that LC16m8 may induce protective immunity against smallpox.	27	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.02642-05	Saijo M, Ami Y, Suzaki Y, Nagata N, Iwata N, Hasegawa H, Ogata M, Fukushi S, Mizutani T, Sata T, Kurata T, Kurane I, Morikawa S.

23626656	A review of experimental and natural infections of animals with monkeypox virus between 1958 and 2012	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) was discovered in 1958 during an outbreak in an animal facility in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since its discovery, MPXV has revealed a propensity to infect and induce disease in a large number of animals within the mammalia class from pan-geographical locations. This finding has impeded the elucidation of the natural host, although the strongest candidates are African squirrels and/or other rodents. Experimentally, MPXV can infect animals via a variety of multiple different inoculation routes; however, the natural route of transmission is unknown and is likely to be somewhat species specific. In this review we have attempted to compile and discuss all published articles that describe experimental or natural infections with MPXV, dating from the initial discovery of the virus through to the year 2012. We further discuss the comparative disease courses and pathologies of the host species.	22	Information Unavailable	aerosol; animals; infection; intrabronchial; intradermal; intramuscular; intranasal; intratracheal; intravenous; outbreak; primates; subcutaneous	10.2217/fvl.12.130	Parker S, Buller RM.

2820094	The role of squirrels in sustaining monkeypox virus transmission	When the research on the ecology of monkeypox virus entered the latest stage in 1984, three groups of animals were considered priority candidates for maintenance of virus circulations in nature because of their relatively higher population density: terrestrial rodents, squirrels, and gregarious bats. Following the isolation of the virus from a wild squirrel in 1985 another survey was carried out in Bumba zone of Zaïre in January-February 1986, which included collection of animal samples, later on tested by WHO collaborating laboratories. No antibodies were found in 233 rodents tested. A high prevalence of monkeypox-specific antibodies (24.7%) found in 320 squirrels of Funisciurus anerythrus species suggested that these animals sustain virus transmission in the areas surrounding human settlements. A consistently high level of antibody prevalence found among squirrels Heliosciurus rufobrachium suggested that this species is also steadily involved in the transmission. The squirrels, the only mammals frequently infected by monkeypox in the areas of human activities, which are frequently trapped by the population, are obviously a major source of infection for human beings. Out of 39 primates collected during the survey from the primary forest, three were found seropositive for monkeypox. At the moment, however, it is difficult to say whether the primates play an important role in sustaining virus transmission in nature, or (like human beings) that they are an occasional host of the virus. Possibilities are discussed of monkeypox virus transmission being sustained by squirrels outside the areas of major human activities.	43	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Khodakevich L, Szczeniowski M, Manbu-ma-Disu, Jezek Z, Marennikova S, Nakano J, Messinger D.

18977501	Experimental infection of an African dormouse (Graphiurus kelleni) with monkeypox virus	Suitable animal models are needed to study monkeypox virus (MPXV) as human monkeypox clinically resembles smallpox and MPXV is a zoonotic and potential bioterroristic agent. We have demonstrated that a species of African dormice, Graphiurus kelleni, is susceptible to a lethal infection of MPXV and that MPXV replicated in multiple organs of this species. Following intranasal administration, MPXV replicated locally in the nasal mucosa causing necrosis and hemorrhage with subsequent systemic spread to lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other tissues where it caused severe necrosis and/or hemorrhage leading to death. The dormouse model was validated for testing prophylactic (Dryvax vaccine) and therapeutic (cidofovir) test articles against intranasal challenges with MPXV.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2008.09.025	Schultz DA, Sagartz JE, Huso DL, Buller RM.

6132084	Human monkeypox transmitted by a chimpanzee in a tropical rain-forest area of Zaire	A case of monkeypox infection in a six-month-old baby girl who had been bitten by a wild chimpanzee in Kivu, Zaire, was investigated. The child had not been exposed to any monkeypox-like disease and no cases of such disease had occurred in the surrounding area during previous months. The time of onset of rash was consistent with the virus having been transmitted from the chimpanzee. However, it is still not known whether chimpanzees and other primates or lower mammals are the primary reservoir of monkeypox infection.	10	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0140-6736(83)92027-5	Mutombo M, Arita I, Jezek Z.

25108113	A highly specific monoclonal antibody against monkeypox virus detects the heparin binding domain of A27	The eradication of smallpox and the cessation of global vaccination led to the increased prevalence of human infections in Central Africa. Serologic and protein-based diagnostic assay for MPXV detection is difficult due to cross-reactive antibodies that do not differentiate between diverse orthopoxvirus (OPXV) species. A previously characterized monoclonal antibody (mAb 69-126-3-7) against MPXV [1] was retested for cross-reactivity with various OPXVs. The 14.5 kDa band protein that reacted with mAb 69-126-3 was identified to be MPXV A29 protein (homolog of vaccinia virus Copenhagen A27). Amino acid sequence analysis of the MPXV A29 with other OPXV homologs identified four amino acid changes. Peptides corresponding to these regions were designed and evaluated for binding to mAb 69-126-3 by ELISA and BioLayer Interferometry (BLI). Further refinement and truncations mapped the specificity of this antibody to a single amino acid difference in a 30-mer peptide compared to other OPXV homologs. This particular residue is proposed to be essential for heparin binding by VACV A27 protein. Despite this substitution, MPXV A29 bound to heparin with similar affinity to that of VACV A27 protein, suggesting flexibility of this motif for heparin binding. Although binding of mAb 69-126-3-7 to MPXV A29 prevented interaction with heparin, it did not have any effect on the infectivity of MPXV. Characterization of 69-126-3-7 mAb antibody allows for the possibility of the generation of a serological based species-specific detection of OPXVs despite high proteomic homology.	1	Information Unavailable	Antibody; Heparin binding; Monkeypox virus; Orthopoxvirus; Vaccinia virus	10.1016/j.virol.2014.06.039	Hughes LJ, Goldstein J, Pohl J, Hooper JW, Lee Pitts R, Townsend MB, Bagarozzi D, Damon IK, Karem KL.

20862223	Experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with aerosolized monkeypox virus	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection in humans results in clinical symptoms very similar to ordinary smallpox. Aerosol is a route of secondary transmission for monkeypox, and a primary route of smallpox transmission in humans. Therefore, an animal model for aerosol exposure to MPXV is needed to test medical countermeasures. To characterize the pathogenesis in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), groups of macaques were exposed to four different doses of aerosolized MPXV. Blood was collected the day before, and every other day after exposure and assessed for complete blood count (CBC), clinical chemistry analysis, and quantitative PCR. Macaques showed mild anorexia, depression, and fever on day 6 post-exposure. Lymphadenopathy, which differentiates monkeypox from smallpox, was observed in exposed macaques around day 6 post-exposure. CBC and clinical chemistries showed abnormalities similar to human monkeypox cases. Whole blood and throat swab viral loads peaked around day 10, and in survivors, gradually decreased until day 28 post-exposure. Survival was not dose dependent. As such, doses of 4 × 10(4) PFU, 1 × 10(5) PFU, or 1 × 10(6) PFU resulted in lethality for 70% of the animals, whereas a dose of 4 × 10(5) PFU resulted in 85% lethality. Overall, cynomolgus macaques exposed to aerosolized MPXV develop a clinical disease that resembles that of human monkeypox. These findings provide a strong foundation for the use of aerosolized MPXV exposure of cynomolgus macaques as an animal model to test medical countermeasures against orthopoxviruses.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0012880	Nalca A, Livingston VA, Garza NL, Zumbrun EE, Frick OM, Chapman JL, Hartings JM.

29972742	Oral Tecovirimat for the Treatment of Smallpox	Background: Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but variola virus (VARV), which causes smallpox, still exists. There is no known effective treatment for smallpox; therefore, tecovirimat is being developed as an oral smallpox therapy. Because clinical trials in a context of natural disease are not possible, an alternative developmental path to evaluate efficacy and safety was needed. Methods: We investigated the efficacy of tecovirimat in nonhuman primate (monkeypox) and rabbit (rabbitpox) models in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Efficacy Rule, which was interpreted for smallpox therapeutics by an expert advisory committee. We also conducted a placebo-controlled pharmacokinetic and safety trial involving 449 adult volunteers. Results: The minimum dose of tecovirimat required in order to achieve more than 90% survival in the monkeypox model was 10 mg per kilogram of body weight for 14 days, and a dose of 40 mg per kilogram for 14 days was similarly efficacious in the rabbitpox model. Although the effective dose per kilogram was higher in rabbits, exposure was lower, with a mean steady-state maximum, minimum, and average (mean) concentration (Cmax, Cmin, and Cavg, respectively) of 374, 25, and 138 ng per milliliter, respectively, in rabbits and 1444, 169, and 598 ng per milliliter in nonhuman primates, as well as an area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) of 3318 ng×hours per milliliter in rabbits and 14,352 ng×hours per milliliter in nonhuman primates. These findings suggested that the nonhuman primate was the more conservative model for the estimation of the required drug exposure in humans. A dose of 600 mg twice daily for 14 days was selected for testing in humans and provided exposures in excess of those in nonhuman primates (mean steady-state Cmax, Cmin, and Cavg of 2209, 690, and 1270 ng per milliliter and AUC0-24hr of 30,632 ng×hours per milliliter). No pattern of troubling adverse events was observed. Conclusions: On the basis of its efficacy in two animal models and pharmacokinetic and safety data in humans, tecovirimat is being advanced as a therapy for smallpox in accordance with the FDA Animal Rule.

21147922	Comparative analysis of monkeypox virus infection of cynomolgus macaques by the intravenous or intrabronchial inoculation route	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection has recently expanded in geographic distribution and can be fatal in up to 10% of cases. The intravenous (i.v.) inoculation of nonhuman primates (NHPs) results in an accelerated fulminant disease course compared to that of naturally occurring MPXV infection in humans. Alternative routes of inoculation are being investigated to define an NHP model of infection that more closely resembles natural disease progression. Our goal was to determine if the intrabronchial (i.b.) exposure of NHPs to MPXV results in a systemic disease that better resembles the progression of human MPXV infection. Here, we compared the disease course following an i.v. or i.b. inoculation of NHPs with 10-fold serial doses of MPXV Zaire. Classical pox-like disease was observed in NHPs administered a high virus dose by either route. Several key events were delayed in the highest doses tested of the i.b. model compared to the timing of the i.v. model, including the onset of fever, lesion appearance, peak viremia, viral shedding in nasal and oral swabs, peak cytokine levels, and time to reach endpoint criteria. Virus distribution across 19 tissues was largely unaffected by the inoculation route at the highest doses tested. The NHPs inoculated by the i.b. route developed a viral pneumonia that likely exacerbated disease progression. Based on the observations of the delayed onset of clinical and virological parameters and endpoint criteria that may more closely resemble those of human MPXV infection, the i.b. MPXV model should be considered for the further investigation of viral pathogenesis and countermeasures.	27	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.01931-10	Johnson RF, Dyall J, Ragland DR, Huzella L, Byrum R, Jett C, St Claire M, Smith AL, Paragas J, Blaney JE, Jahrling PB.

30123790	Evolution of a Disease Surveillance System: An Increase in Reporting of Human Monkeypox Disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2001-2013	"Objective: Evaluating the effectiveness of a surveillance system, and how it improves over time has significant implications for disease control and prevention. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) was implemented to estimate the burden of disease, monitor changes in disease occurrence, and inform resource allocation. For this effort we utilized national passive surveillance data from DRC's IDSR to explore reporting trends of human monkeypox (MPX) from 2001 to 2013. Methods: We obtained surveillance data on MPX cases occurring between January 2001 and December 2013 from the DRC Ministry of Health (MoH). Phases of the surveillance system, yearly trends in reporting and estimated incidence for MPX were analyzed using SAS v9.2 and Health Mapper. Results: Between 2001 and 2013, three discrete surveillance phases were identified that described the evolution of the surveillance system. Overall, an increase in suspected MPX cases was reported, beyond what would be expected from simply an improved reporting system. When restricting the analysis to the ""stable phase,"" national estimated incidence increased from 2.13 per 100,000 in 2008 to 2.84 per 100,000 in 2013. Conclusions: The reported increase in MPX, based on an evolving surveillance system, is likely to be a true increase in disease occurrence rather than simply improvements to the surveillance system. Further analyses should provide critical information for improved prevention and control strategies and highlight areas of improvement for future data collection efforts."	5	Information Unavailable	Democratic Republic of Congo; Monkeypox; disease trends; passive surveillance	10.9734/IJTDH/2017/35885	Hoff NA, Doshi RH, Colwell B, Kebela-Illunga B, Mukadi P, Mossoko M, Spencer D, Muyembe-Tamfum JJ, Okitolonda-Wemakoy E, Lloyd-Smith J, Rimoin AW.

32882158	An overview of tecovirimat for smallpox treatment and expanded anti-orthopoxvirus applications	Introduction: Tecovirimat (TPOXX®; ST-246) was approved for the treatment of symptomatic smallpox by the USFDA in July of 2018 and has been stockpiled by the US government for use in a smallpox outbreak. While there has not been a reported case of smallpox since 1978 it is still considered a serious bioterrorism threat. Areas covered: A brief history of smallpox from its proposed origins as a human disease through its eradication in the late 20th century is presented. The current smallpox threat and the current public health response plans are described. The discovery, and development of tecovirimat through NDA submission and subsequent approval for treatment of smallpox are discussed. Google Scholar and PubMed were searched over all available dates for relevant publications. Expert opinion: Approval of tecovirimat to treat smallpox represents an important milestone in biosecurity preparedness. Incorporating tecovirimat into the CDC smallpox response plan, development of pediatric liquid and intravenous formulations, and approval for post-exposure prophylaxis would provide additional health security benefit.Tecovirimat shows broad efficacy against orthopoxviruses in vitro and in vivo and could be developed for use against emerging orthopoxvirus diseases such as monkeypox, vaccination-associated adverse events, and side effects of vaccinia oncolytic virus therapy.	2	Review	Animal Rule; ST-246; Smallpox; biodefense; health security; monkeypox; tecovirimat; vaccinia; variola	10.1080/14787210.2020.1819791	Russo AT, Grosenbach DW, Chinsangaram J, Honeychurch KM, Long PG, Lovejoy C, Maiti B, Meara I, Hruby DE.

25462355	Comparative live bioluminescence imaging of monkeypox virus dissemination in a wild-derived inbred mouse (Mus musculus castaneus) and outbred African dormouse (Graphiurus kelleni)	Monkeypox virus belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus, infects rodents and monkeys in Africa, produces a smallpox-like zoonotic disease in humans, and has the potential for global spread and exploitation for bioterrorism. Several small animal models for studying monkeypox virus pathogenesis have been investigated. The African dormouse is a candidate natural host but is outbred and no immunological reagents exist. Although not a natural host, the CAST/EiJ mouse is inbred and animals and reagents are commercially available. We compared the dissemination of monkeypox virus by bioluminescence imaging in CAST/EiJ mice and dormice. In CAST/EiJ mice, intense replication occurred at the intranasal site of inoculation and virus spread rapidly to lungs and abdominal organs, which had a lower virus burden. Compared to CAST/EiJ mice, dormice exhibited a greater variation of virus spread, a slower time course, less replication in the head and chest, and more replication in abdominal organs prior to death.	13	Comparative Study	Animal models; Monkeypox virus pathogenesis; Monkeypox virus virulence; Orthopoxviruses; Smallpox	10.1016/j.virol.2014.11.015	Earl PL, Americo JL, Cotter CA, Moss B.

18205298	Comparative proteomics of human monkeypox and vaccinia intracellular mature and extracellular enveloped virions	Orthopoxviruses are among the largest and most complex of the animal viruses. In response to the recent emergence of monkeypox in Africa and the threat of smallpox bioterrorism, two orthopoxviruses with different pathogenic potentials, human monkeypox virus and vaccinia virus, were proteomically compared with the goal of identifying proteins required for pathogenesis. Orthopoxviruses were grown in HeLa cells to two different viral forms (intracellular mature virus and extracellular enveloped virus), purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, denatured using RapiGest surfactant, and digested with trypsin. Unfractionated samples and strong cation exchange HPLC fractions were analyzed by high-resolution reversed-phase nano-LC-MS/MS, and analyses of the MS/MS spectra using SEQUEST and X! Tandem resulted in the confident identification of hundreds of monkeypox, vaccinia, and copurified host-cell proteins. The unfractionated samples were additionally analyzed by LC-MS using an LTQ-Orbitrap, and the accurate mass and elution time tag approach was used to perform quantitative comparisons.

18678911	Rapid protection in a monkeypox model by a single injection of a replication-deficient vaccinia virus	The success of the World Health Organization smallpox eradication program three decades ago resulted in termination of routine vaccination and consequent decline in population immunity. Despite concerns regarding the reintroduction of smallpox, there is little enthusiasm for large-scale redeployment of licensed live vaccinia virus vaccines because of medical contraindications and anticipated serious side effects. Therefore, highly attenuated strains such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) are under evaluation in humans and animal models. Previous studies showed that priming and boosting with MVA provided protection for >2 years in a monkeypox virus challenge model. If variola virus were used as a biological weapon, however, the ability of a vaccine to quickly induce immunity would be essential. Here, we demonstrate more rapid immune responses after a single vaccination with MVA compared to the licensed Dryvax vaccine. To determine the kinetics of protection of the two vaccines, macaques were challenged intravenously with monkeypox virus at 4, 6, 10, and 30 days after immunization. At 6 or more days after vaccination with MVA or Dryvax, the monkeys were clinically protected (except for 1 of 16 animals vaccinated with MVA), although viral loads and number of skin lesions were generally higher in the MVA vaccinated group. With only 4 days between immunization and intravenous challenge, however, MVA still protected whereas Dryvax failed. Protection correlated with the more rapid immune response to MVA compared to Dryvax, which may be related to the higher dose of MVA that can be tolerated safely.	41	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1073/pnas.0804985105	Earl PL, Americo JL, Wyatt LS, Espenshade O, Bassler J, Gong K, Lin S, Peters E, Rhodes L Jr, Spano YE, Silvera PM, Moss B.

26517724	Laboratory Investigations of African Pouched Rats (Cricetomys gambianus) as a Potential Reservoir Host Species for Monkeypox Virus	Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease endemic to central and western Africa, where it is a major public health concern. Although Monkeypox virus (MPXV) and monkeypox disease in humans have been well characterized, little is known about its natural history, or its maintenance in animal populations of sylvatic reservoir(s). In 2003, several species of rodents imported from Ghana were involved in a monkeypox outbreak in the United States with individuals of three African rodent genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, Funisciurus) shown to be infected with MPXV. Here, we examine the course of MPXV infection in Cricetomys gambianus (pouched Gambian rats) and this rodent species' competence as a host for the virus. We obtained ten Gambian rats from an introduced colony in Grassy Key, Florida and infected eight of these via scarification with a challenge dose of 4X104 plaque forming units (pfu) from either of the two primary clades of MPXV: Congo Basin (C-MPXV: n = 4) or West African (W-MPXV: n = 4); an additional 2 animals served as PBS controls. Viral shedding and the effect of infection on activity and physiological aspects of the animals were measured. MPXV challenged animals had significantly higher core body temperatures, reduced activity and increased weight loss than PBS controls. Viable virus was found in samples taken from animals in both experimental groups (C-MPXV and W-MPXV) between 3 and 27 days post infection (p.i.) (up to 1X108 pfu/ml), with viral DNA found until day 56 p.i. The results from this work show that Cricetomys gambianus (and by inference, probably the closely related species, Cricetomys emini) can be infected with MPXV and shed viable virus particles; thus suggesting that these animals may be involved in the maintenance of MPXV in wildlife mammalian populations. More research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology of MPXV and the role of Gambian rats and other species.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0004013	Hutson CL, Nakazawa YJ, Self J, Olson VA, Regnery RL, Braden Z, Weiss S, Malekani J, Jackson E, Tate M, Karem KL, Rocke TE, Osorio JE, Damon IK, Carroll DS.

28814515	[ 18 F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose Uptake in Lymphoid Tissue Serves as a Predictor of Disease Outcome in the Nonhuman Primate Model of Monkeypox Virus Infection	Real-time bioimaging of infectious disease processes may aid countermeasure development and lead to an improved understanding of pathogenesis. However, few studies have identified biomarkers for monitoring infections using in vivo imaging. Previously, we demonstrated that positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) can monitor monkeypox disease progression in vivo in nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this study, we investigated [18F]-FDG-PET/CT imaging of immune processes in lymphoid tissues to identify patterns of inflammation in the monkepox NHP model and to determine the value of [18F]-FDG-PET/CT as a biomarker for disease and treatment outcomes. Quantitative analysis of [18F]-FDG-PET/CT images revealed differences between moribund and surviving animals at two sites vital to the immune response to viral infections, bone marrow and lymph nodes (LNs). Moribund NHPs demonstrated increased [18F]-FDG uptake in bone marrow 4 days postinfection compared to surviving NHPs. In surviving, treated NHPs, increase in LN volume correlated with [18F]-FDG uptake and peaked 10 days postinfection, while minimal lymphadenopathy and higher glycolytic activity were observed in moribund NHPs early in infection. Imaging data were supported by standard virology, pathology, and immunology findings. Even with the limited number of subjects, imaging was able to differentiate the difference between disease outcomes, warranting additional studies to demonstrate whether [18F]-FDG-PET/CT can identify other, subtler effects. Visualizing altered metabolic activity at sites involved in the immune response by [18F]-FDG-PET/CT imaging is a powerful tool for identifying key disease-specific time points and locations that are most relevant for pathogenesis and treatment.IMPORTANCE Positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging is a universal tool in oncology and neuroscience. The application of this technology to infectious diseases is far less developed. We used PET/CT imaging with [18F]-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) in monkeys after monkeypox virus exposure to monitor the immune response in lymphoid tissues. In lymph nodes of surviving monkeys, changes in [18F]-FDG uptake positively correlated with enlargement of the lymph nodes and peaked on day 10 postinfection. In contrast, the bone marrow and lymph nodes of nonsurvivors showed increased [18F]-FDG uptake by day 4 postinfection with minimal lymph node enlargement, indicating that elevated cell metabolic activity early after infection is predictive of disease outcome. [18F]-FDG-PET/CT imaging can provide real-time snapshots of metabolic activity changes in response to viral infections and identify key time points and locations most relevant for monitoring the development of pathogenesis and for potential treatment to be effective.	3	Information Unavailable	PET/CT; cidofovir; imaging; monkeypox virus; nonhuman primate; orthopoxvirus; virus	10.1128/JVI.00897-17	Dyall J, Johnson RF, Chefer S, Leyson C, Thomasson D, Seidel J, Ragland DR, Byrum R, Jett C, Cann JA, St Claire M, Jagoda E, Reba RC, Hammoud D, Blaney JE, Jahrling PB.

21635922	Species-specific identification of variola, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses by multiplex real-time PCR assay	A method of one-stage rapid identification of variola (VARV), monkeypox (MPXV), cowpox (CPXV), and vaccinia (VACV) viruses, pathogenic for humans, utilizing multiplex real-time TaqMan PCR (MuRT-PCR) assay was developed. Four pairs of oligonucleotide primers and four hybridization probes with various fluorescent dyes and the corresponding fluorescence quenchers were concurrently used for MuRT-PCR assay. The hybridization probe specific for the VARV sequence contained FAM/BHQ1 as a dye/quencher pair; MPXV-specific, TAMRA/BHQ2; CPXV-specific, JOE/BHQ1; VACV-specific, Cy5/BHQ3. The specificity and sensitivity of the developed method were assessed by analyzing DNA of 29 strains belonging to six orthopoxvirus species as well as the DNA samples isolated from archive clinical specimens of human smallpox cases and experimental specimens isolated from CPXV-infected mice and MPXV-infected marmot.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.05.002	Shchelkunov SN, Shcherbakov DN, Maksyutov RA, Gavrilova EV.

33396609	Here, There, and Everywhere: The Wide Host Range and Geographic Distribution of Zoonotic Orthopoxviruses	The global emergence of zoonotic viruses, including poxviruses, poses one of the greatest threats to human and animal health. Forty years after the eradication of smallpox, emerging zoonotic orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses continue to infect humans as well as wild and domestic animals. Currently, the geographical distribution of poxviruses in a broad range of hosts worldwide raises concerns regarding the possibility of outbreaks or viral dissemination to new geographical regions. Here, we review the global host ranges and current epidemiological understanding of zoonotic orthopoxviruses while focusing on orthopoxviruses with epidemic potential, including monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses.	7	Review	Cowpox virus; Monkeypox virus; Orthopoxvirus; Poxviridae; Vaccinia virus; emergent viruses; host range; outbreak; wild and domestic animals; zoonosis	10.3390/v13010043	Silva NIO, de Oliveira JS, Kroon EG, Trindade GS, Drumond BP.

26380309	Comparison of Monkeypox Virus Clade Kinetics and Pathology within the Prairie Dog Animal Model Using a Serial Sacrifice Study Design	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection of the prairie dog is valuable to studying systemic orthopoxvirus disease. To further characterize differences in MPXV clade pathogenesis, groups of prairie dogs were intranasally infected (8 × 10(3) p.f.u.) with Congo Basin (CB) or West African (WA) MPXV, and 28 tissues were harvested on days 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 17, and 24 postinfection. Samples were evaluated for the presence of virus and gross and microscopic lesions. Virus was recovered from nasal mucosa, oropharyngeal lymph nodes, and spleen earlier in CB challenged animals (day 4) than WA challenged animals (day 6). For both groups, primary viremia (indicated by viral DNA) was seen on days 6-9 through day 17. CB MPXV spread more rapidly, accumulated to greater levels, and caused greater morbidity in animals compared to WA MPXV. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings, however, were similar. Two animals that succumbed to disease demonstrated abundant viral antigen in all organs tested, except for brain. Dual-IHC staining of select liver and spleen sections showed that apoptotic cells (identified by TUNEL) tended to colocalize with poxvirus antigen. Interestingly splenocytes were labelled positive for apoptosis more often than hepatocytes in both MPXV groups. These findings allow for further characterization of differences between MPXV clade pathogenesis, including identifying sites that are important during early viral replication and cellular response to viral infection.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1155/2015/965710	Hutson CL, Carroll DS, Gallardo-Romero N, Drew C, Zaki SR, Nagy T, Hughes C, Olson VA, Sanders J, Patel N, Smith SK, Keckler MS, Karem K, Damon IK.

27024916	[Development of the disease in marmot at the intranasal infection with the monkeypox virus]	In experimental study the sensitivity of the Marmota bobak species to the monkeypox virus (MPXV) with the intranasal (i/n) infection was tested. It was demonstrated that 50% of the infective dose (ID50) of the MPXV on external clinical signs of the disease was 2.2 Ig plaque forming units (PFU). The percentage of the marmot mortality is slightly dependent on the infecting dose of the MPXV, therefore it is not possible to correctly determine the value of 50 % fatal dose (FD50) for these animals. The most pronounced external clinical signs of the disease were obtained in the marmots: pox-like skin rash throughout the surface of the body and mucous membranes, purulent discharge from the nose, lymphadenitis, discoordination, tremor of the extremities, fever, increased aggression, and ruffled fur. In the course of experiments intended to determine the dynamics of the accumulation of the MPXV in various organs, tissues, and blood serum of marmot infected i/n with dose of 3.7 Ig PFU, it was found that the trachea, lungs, and the bifurcation lymph nodes are the primary target organs. The trachea, lungs, nasal mucosa membrane, and skin are the organs with maximal virus replication recorded at 5, 7, 9, and 12 days after the infection. The transfer of the MPXV into the secondary target organs (nasal mucosa membrane, brain, spleen, duodenum, adrenal glands, and skin) was carried out in marmots with lymphogenic and hematogenic ways of the dissemination of the infection.

19382264	Loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based diagnostic assay for monkeypox virus infections	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) causes a smallpox-like disease in non-human primates and humans. This infection is endemic to central and western Africa. MPXV is divided into two genetically different groups, Congo Basin and West African MPXV, with the former being the more virulent. A real-time quantitative MPXV genome amplification system was developed for the diagnosis of MPXV infections using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology. Primers used for genome amplification of Congo Basin (C-LAMP), West African (W-LAMP), and both Congo Basin and West African (COM-LAMP) MPXV by LAMP were designed according to the nucleotide sequences of the Congo Basin-specific D14L gene, the West African-specific partial ATI gene, and the partial ATI gene that is shared by both groups, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP were evaluated with nested PCR using peripheral blood and throat swab specimens collected from Congo Basin MPXV or West African MPXV-infected monkeys. The sensitivity and specificity of COM-LAMP, C-LAMP, and W-LAMP were 80% (45/56) and 100% (64/64); 79% (19/24) and 100% (24/24); and 72% (23/32) and 100% (40/40), respectively. The viremia level determined by LAMP assays increased with increases in the severity of the monkeypox-associated symptoms. The newly developed LAMP assay was confirmed to be a rapid, quantifiable, and highly sensitive and specific system effective in the diagnosis of MPXV infections. The LAMP assays made it possible to discriminate between Congo Basin and West African MPXV. The LAMP developed in this study is useful not only for diagnosis of but also for the assessment of MPXV infections.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.21494	Iizuka I, Saijo M, Shiota T, Ami Y, Suzaki Y, Nagata N, Hasegawa H, Sakai K, Fukushi S, Mizutani T, Ogata M, Nakauchi M, Kurane I, Mizuguchi M, Morikawa S.

75947	Serological relatedness of monkeypox, variola, and vaccinia viruses	Closely related human and monkey orthopoxviruses were differentiated by serologic techniques. Antiviral sera were tested by immunodiffusion for reactivity against six different viral antigens prepared from either infected cell cultures or infected chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of embryonated eggs. Portions of each antiserum were separately absorbed with heterologous antigens from infected CAMs to remove common reactivity. The absorbed sera formed immunodiffusion precipitates with both types of antigen preparation and revealed specific-character differences that made it possible to classify the viruses as variola, vaccinia, or monkeypox. Cross-complement fixation tests were also used to examine the immunologic reactivities of antisera to detergent-treated, purified preparations of three orthopoxviruses. Only common reactivities were detected by this method, however, and differentiating reactivities were not observed.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.1890010107	Esposito JJ, Obijeski JF, Nakano JH.

23425254	Comparison of host cell gene expression in cowpox, monkeypox or vaccinia virus-infected cells reveals virus-specific regulation of immune response genes	Background: Animal-borne orthopoxviruses, like monkeypox, vaccinia and the closely related cowpox virus, are all capable of causing zoonotic infections in humans, representing a potential threat to human health. The disease caused by each virus differs in terms of symptoms and severity, but little is yet know about the reasons for these varying phenotypes. They may be explained by the unique repertoire of immune and host cell modulating factors encoded by each virus. In this study, we analysed the specific modulation of the host cell's gene expression profile by cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia virus infection. We aimed to identify mechanisms that are either common to orthopoxvirus infection or specific to certain orthopoxvirus species, allowing a more detailed description of differences in virus-host cell interactions between individual orthopoxviruses. To this end, we analysed changes in host cell gene expression of HeLa cells in response to infection with cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia virus, using whole-genome gene expression microarrays, and compared these to each other and to non-infected cells. Results: Despite a dominating non-responsiveness of cellular transcription towards orthopoxvirus infection, we could identify several clusters of infection-modulated genes. These clusters are either commonly regulated by orthopoxvirus infection or are uniquely regulated by infection with a specific orthopoxvirus, with major differences being observed in immune response genes. Most noticeable was an induction of genes involved in leukocyte migration and activation in cowpox and monkeypox virus-infected cells, which was not observed following vaccinia virus infection. Conclusion: Despite their close genetic relationship, the expression profiles induced by infection with different orthopoxviruses vary significantly. It may be speculated that these differences at the cellular level contribute to the individual characteristics of cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia virus infections in certain host species.	13	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-10-61	Bourquain D, Dabrowski PW, Nitsche A.

20736407	Characterization of macaque pulmonary fluid proteome during monkeypox infection: dynamics of host response	Understanding viral pathogenesis is challenging because of confounding factors, including nonabrasive access to infected tissues and high abundance of inflammatory mediators that may mask mechanistic details. In diseases such as influenza and smallpox where the primary cause of mortality results from complications in the lung, the characterization of lung fluid offers a unique opportunity to study host-pathogen interactions with minimal effect on infected animals. This investigation characterizes the global proteome response in the pulmonary fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, of macaques during upper respiratory infection by monkeypox virus (MPXV), a close relative of the causative agent of smallpox, variola virus. These results are compared and contrasted against infections by vaccinia virus (VV), a low pathogenic relative of MPXV, and with extracellular fluid from MPXV-infected HeLa cells. To identify changes in the pulmonary protein compartment, macaque lung fluid was sampled twice prior to infection, serving as base line, and up to six times following intrabronchial infection with either MPXV or VV. Increased expression of inflammatory proteins was observed in response to both viruses. Although the increased expression resolved for a subset of proteins, such as C-reactive protein, S100A8, and S100A9, high expression levels persisted for other proteins, including vitamin D-binding protein and fibrinogen γ. Structural and metabolic proteins were substantially decreased in lung fluid exclusively during MPXV and not VV infection. Decreases in structural and metabolic proteins were similarly observed in the extracellular fluid of MPXV-infected HeLa cells. Results from this study suggest that the host inflammatory response may not be the only facilitator of viral pathogenesis, but rather maintaining pulmonary structural integrity could be a key factor influencing disease progression and mortality.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1074/mcp.M110.001875	Brown JN, Estep RD, Lopez-Ferrer D, Brewer HM, Clauss TR, Manes NP, O'Connor M, Li H, Adkins JN, Wong SW, Smith RD.

16517741	Structure and regulatory profile of the monkeypox inhibitor of complement: comparison to homologs in vaccinia and variola and evidence for dimer formation	The outbreak of monkeypox in the Unites States in the summer of 2003 was the first occurrence of this smallpox-like disease outside of Africa. This limited human epidemic resulted from cross-infection of prairie dogs by imported African rodents. Although there were no human fatalities, this outbreak illustrates that monkeypox is an emerging natural infection and a potential biological weapon. We characterized a virulence factor expressed by monkeypox (monkeypox inhibitor of complement enzymes or MOPICE). We also compared its structure and regulatory function to homologous complement regulatory proteins of variola (SPICE) and vaccinia (VCP). In multiple expression systems, 5-30% of MOPICE, SPICE, and VCP consisted of function-enhancing disulfide-linked homodimers. Mammalian cells infected with vaccinia virus also expressed VCP dimers. MOPICE bound human C3b/C4b intermediate to that of SPICE and VCP. Cofactor activity of MOPICE was similar to VCP, but both were approximately 100-fold less efficient than SPICE. SPICE and VCP, but not MOPICE, possessed decay-accelerating activity for the C3 and C5 convertases of the classical pathway. Additionally, all three regulators possessed heparin-binding capability. These studies demonstrate that MOPICE regulates human complement and suggest that dimerization is a prominent feature of these virulence factors. Thus, our data add novel information relative to the functional repertoire of these poxviral virulence factors. Furthermore, targeting and neutralizing these complement regulatory active sites via mAbs is a therapeutic approach that may enhance protection against smallpox.	43	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.4049/jimmunol.176.6.3725	Liszewski MK, Leung MK, Hauhart R, Buller RM, Bertram P, Wang X, Rosengard AM, Kotwal GJ, Atkinson JP.

17507071	DNA/MVA HIV-1/AIDS vaccine elicits long-lived vaccinia virus-specific immunity and confers protection against a lethal monkeypox challenge	Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is being tested in humans as an alternative to the current smallpox vaccine Dryvax. Here, we compare the magnitude and longevity of protective immune responses elicited by a DNA/MVA HIV-1 vaccine with those elicited by Dryvax using a monkeypox virus/macaque model. The DNA/MVA vaccine elicited similar levels of vaccinia virus (VV)-specific antibody and 5-10-fold lower levels of VV-specific cellular responses than Dryvax. This MVA-elicited cellular and humoral immunity was long-lived. A subset of the DNA/MVA- and Dryvax-vaccinated macaques were subjected to a lethal monkeypox virus challenge at 3 years after vaccination. All of the vaccinated monkeys survived, whereas the unvaccinated controls succumbed to monkeypox. The viral control correlated with early postchallenge levels of monkeypox-specific neutralizing antibody but not with VV-specific cellular immune response. Thus, our results demonstrate the elicitation of long lasting protective immunity for a lethal monkeypox challenge by a DNA/MVA HIV-1 vaccine.	20	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2007.04.010	Nigam P, Earl PL, Americo JL, Sharma S, Wyatt LS, Edghill-Spano Y, Chennareddi LS, Silvera P, Moss B, Robinson HL, Amara RR.

25120821	Pathogenesis of fulminant monkeypox with bacterial sepsis after experimental infection with West African monkeypox virus in a cynomolgus monkey	The pathogenesis of severe human monkeypox, which causes systemic and fulminant infections, is not clear. This study presents a case repot of fulminant monkeypox with bacterial sepsis after experimental infection with monkeypox virus in a cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). In our previous study (Saijo et al., 2009, J Gen Virol), two cynomolgus monkeys became moribund after experimental infection with monkeypox virus Liberia strain, West African strain. One exhibited typical monkeypox-related papulovesicular lesions. The other monkey presented fulminant clinical symptoms with a characteristic flat red rash similar to that found in smallpox, which is associated with extremely high fatality rates. In this study, we found that the monkey with flat red rash had high levels of viremia and neutropenia, as well as high plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with the other monkey. Monkeypox virus replicates in epithelial cells and macrophages in various organs. Sepsis due to Gram-positive cocci was confirmed histopathologically in the monkey with flat red rash. The lack of inflammatory response in the lesion suggested that the monkey with sepsis experienced strong immune suppression during the viral infection. The neutropenia and excessive inflammatory cytokine responses indicate that neutrophils play key roles in the pathogenesis of systemic and fulminant human monkeypox virus infections with sepsis.	4	Case Reports	Animal model; cynomolgus monkey; cytokine; monkeypox; neutropenia	Information Unavailable	Nagata N, Saijo M, Kataoka M, Ami Y, Suzaki Y, Sato Y, Iwata-Yoshikawa N, Ogata M, Kurane I, Morikawa S, Sata T, Hasegawa H.

20019241	The highly virulent variola and monkeypox viruses express secreted inhibitors of type I interferon	Variola virus (VARV) caused smallpox, one of the most devastating human diseases and the first to be eradicated, but its deliberate release represents a dangerous threat. Virulent orthopoxviruses infecting humans, such as monkeypox virus (MPXV), could fill the niche left by smallpox eradication and the cessation of vaccination. However, immunomodulatory activities and virulence determinants of VARV and MPXV remain largely unexplored. We report the molecular characterization of the VARV- and MPXV-secreted type I interferon-binding proteins, which interact with the cell surface after secretion and prevent type I interferon responses. The proteins expressed in the baculovirus system have been purified, and their interferon-binding properties characterized by surface plasmon resonance. The ability of these proteins to inhibit a broad range of interferons was investigated to identify potential adaptation to the human immune system. Furthermore, we demonstrate by Western blot and activity assays the expression of the type I interferon inhibitor during VARV and MPXV infections. These findings are relevant for the design of new vaccines and therapeutics to smallpox and emergent virulent orthopoxviruses because the type I interferon-binding protein is a major virulence factor in animal models, vaccination with this protein induces protective immunity, and its neutralization prevents disease progression.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1096/fj.09-144733	Fernández de Marco Mdel M, Alejo A, Hudson P, Damon IK, Alcami A.

20659519	A protein-based smallpox vaccine protects non-human primates from a lethal monkeypox virus challenge	Concerns about infections caused by orthopoxviruses, such as variola and monkeypox viruses, drive ongoing efforts to develop novel smallpox vaccines that are both effective and safe to use in diverse populations. A subunit smallpox vaccine comprising vaccinia virus membrane proteins A33, B5, L1, A27 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) ± CpG was administered to non-human primates, which were subsequently challenged with a lethal intravenous dose of monkeypox virus. Alum adjuvanted vaccines provided only partial protection but the addition of CpG provided full protection that was associated with a more homogeneous antibody response and stronger IgG1 responses. These results indicate that it is feasible to develop a highly effective subunit vaccine against orthopoxvirus infections as a safer alternative to live vaccinia virus vaccination.	23	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.07.030	Buchman GW, Cohen ME, Xiao Y, Richardson-Harman N, Silvera P, DeTolla LJ, Davis HL, Eisenberg RJ, Cohen GH, Isaacs SN.

16023693	Virulence differences between monkeypox virus isolates from West Africa and the Congo basin	Studies indicate that West African and Congo basin isolates of monkeypox virus (MPXV) are genetically distinct. Here, we show Congo basin MPXV-ZAI-V79 is more virulent for cynomolgus monkeys as compared to presumed West African MPXV-COP-58. This finding may explain the lack of case-fatalities in the U.S. 2003 monkeypox outbreak, which was caused by a West African virus. Virulence differences between West African and Congo basin MPXV are further supported by epidemiological analyses that observed a similar prevalence of antibodies in non-vaccinated humans in both regions, while >90% of reported cases occurred in the Congo basin, and no fatal cases were observed outside of this region. To determine the basis for this difference in virulence, we sequenced the genomes of one human West African isolate, and two presumed West African isolates and compared the sequences to Congo basin MPXV-ZAI-96-I-16. The analysis identified D10L, D14L, B10R, B14R, and B19R as possible virulence genes, with D14L (ortholog of vaccinia complement protein) as a leading candidate.	82	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2005.05.030	Chen N, Li G, Liszewski MK, Atkinson JP, Jahrling PB, Feng Z, Schriewer J, Buck C, Wang C, Lefkowitz EJ, Esposito JJ, Harms T, Damon IK, Roper RL, Upton C, Buller RM.

34563454	The Disease Ecology, Epidemiology, Clinical Manifestations, Management, Prevention, and Control of Increasing Human Infections with Animal Orthopoxviruses	Zoonotic orthopoxvirus outbreaks have occurred repeatedly worldwide, including monkeypox in Africa and the United States, cowpox in Europe, camelpox in the Middle East and India, buffalopox in India, vaccinia in South America, and novel emerging orthopoxvirus infections in the United States, Europe, Asia, and South America. Waning smallpox immunity may increase the potential for animal-to-human transmission followed by further community transmission person-to-person (as demonstrated by monkeypox and buffalopox outbreaks) and by contact with fomites (as demonstrated by camelpox, cowpox, and, possibly, Alaskapox). The objectives of this review are to describe the disease ecology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, prevention, and control of human infections with animal orthopoxviruses and to discuss the association with diminished population herd immunity formerly induced by vaccinia vaccination against smallpox. Internet search engines were queried with key words, and case reports, case series, seroprevalence studies, and epidemiologic investigations were found for review.	1	Review	buffalopox; camelpox; cowpox; monkeypox; smallpox; vaccinia; variola; zoonoses	10.1016/j.wem.2021.08.003	Diaz JH.

2825518	Stochastic model for interhuman spread of monkeypox	"With the eradication of smallpox, systematic routine vaccination with vaccinia has ceased and an increasing proportion of the human population in tropical rain forest areas of central and western Africa lacks vaccinia-derived immunity to monkeypox virus. This raises the question of the ability of monkeypox virus to establish and maintain itself in an unvaccinated population through continuous man-to-man transmission. A computerized stochastic model of Monte Carlo type was constructed to assess this potential risk. Simulated series were repeated 100 times to obtain distributions of predicted outcomes for decreasing levels of vaccination coverage (70 per cent, 50 per cent, and 0 per cent). The results revealed a substantial increase in new secondary cases in the total absence of vaccinia-induced immunity. Nevertheless, none of the simulated series did lead to an ""explosive"" epidemic. The model clearly indicated diminishing numbers of cases in successive generations and eventual cessation of transmission. Therefore, it appears highly improbable that the virus could maintain itself permanently in communities by interhuman transmission. After the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox constitutes the most important orthopoxvirus infection in man, but analysis of information collected up to this time suggests that it does not represent currently a serious public health problem or a challenge to the achieved eradication of smallpox."	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114747	Jezek Z, Grab B, Dixon H.

19474247	Virulence and pathophysiology of the Congo Basin and West African strains of monkeypox virus in non-human primates	Monkeypox virus is divided into Congo Basin and West African strains. The virulence and pathophysiology of two strains, Zr-599 (a Congo Basin monkeypox virus) and Liberia (a West African monkeypox virus), were evaluated in non-human primates. Four monkeys were infected by the subcutaneous (SC) and two by the intranasal (IN) inoculation routes for Zr-599 and Liberia at a dose of 10(6) p.f.u. One monkey in the Liberia/SC group was demonstrated to be co-infected with Gram-positive cocci and was excluded from analyses. Infections in three of the four Zr-599/SC monkeys and in one of the three Liberia/SC monkeys were fatal. Virus genome levels in blood in the Zr-599/SC monkeys were approximately 10 times higher than those in the Liberia/SC monkeys. Zr-599 affected respiratory, genito-urinary and gastrointestinal tract organs more severely than Liberia. Zr-599 was more virulent than Liberia and one of the factors might be the difference in organ tropism.	20	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1099/vir.0.010207-0	Saijo M, Ami Y, Suzaki Y, Nagata N, Iwata N, Hasegawa H, Iizuka I, Shiota T, Sakai K, Ogata M, Fukushi S, Mizutani T, Sata T, Kurata T, Kurane I, Morikawa S.

16086024	Multiple diagnostic techniques identify previously vaccinated individuals with protective immunity against monkeypox	Approximately 50% of the US population received smallpox vaccinations before routine immunization ceased in 1972 for civilians and in 1990 for military personnel. Several studies have shown long-term immunity after smallpox vaccination, but skepticism remains as to whether this will translate into full protection against the onset of orthopoxvirus-induced disease. The US monkeypox outbreak of 2003 provided the opportunity to examine this issue. Using independent and internally validated diagnostic approaches with >or=95% sensitivity and >or=90% specificity for detecting clinical monkeypox infection, we identified three previously unreported cases of monkeypox in preimmune individuals at 13, 29 and 48 years after smallpox vaccination. These individuals were unaware that they had been infected because they were spared any recognizable disease symptoms. Together, this shows that the US monkeypox outbreak was larger than previously realized and, more importantly, shows that cross-protective antiviral immunity against West African monkeypox can potentially be maintained for decades after smallpox vaccination.	47	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/nm1273	Hammarlund E, Lewis MW, Carter SV, Amanna I, Hansen SG, Strelow LI, Wong SW, Yoshihara P, Hanifin JM, Slifka MK.

19346366	Monkeypox or varicella? Lessons from a rash outbreak investigation in the Republic of the Congo	Monkeypox virus and varicellazoster virus (VZV) cause visually similar rash illnesses. Monkeypox is more virulent, with fatality rates up to 10%. In June 2007, reports were received of a rash illness outbreak in isolated villages in Likouala district, Republic of the Congo. Blood specimens were obtained from 142 individuals reporting rash illness between January and September 2007 from four villages in Likouala. Thirty-seven cases of probable VZV were identified based on low VZV IgG avidity; cases occurred in all four villages. No probable monkeypox cases with orthopoxvirus-positive IgM responses were observed; however, three possible monkeypox cases, in individuals < 26 years of age, with rash illness occurring > 56 days before sampling and positive orthopoxvirus-specific IgG responses, were identified. Remoteness and delays in reporting limited collection of acute diagnostic specimens. Improvements in rash illness surveillance and infection control, through training of health workers and timely acquisition of diagnostic specimens, are being undertaken.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	MacNeil A, Reynolds MG, Carroll DS, Karem K, Braden Z, Lash R, Moundeli A, Mombouli JV, Jumaan AO, Schmid DS, Damon IK.

Among individuals vaccinated >20 years prior, 9 (14%) of 66 individuals demonstrated VV-specific interferon (IFN)- gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay responses; 21 (50%) of 42 had lymphoproliferative (LP) responses, and 29 (97%) of 30 had VV-specific neutralizing antibodies. One year after monkeypox virus infection, 6 of 7 individuals had IFN- gamma ELISPOT responses, all had VV-specific LP responses, and 3 of 7 had VV-specific neutralizing antibodies. Of 8 individuals with a history of variola virus infection, 1 had a VV-specific IFN- gamma ELISPOT response, 4 had LP responses against whole VV, 7 had LP responses against heat-denatured vaccinia antigen, and 7 had VV-specific neutralizing antibodies. Survivors of variola virus infection demonstrated VV-specific CD4 memory cell responses and neutralizing antibodies >40 years after infection.	9	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1086/512161	Sivapalasingam S, Kennedy JS, Borkowsky W, Valentine F, Zhan MX, Pazoles P, Paolino A, Ennis FA, Steigbigel NH.

20130052	A mouse model of lethal infection for evaluating prophylactics and therapeutics against Monkeypox virus	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus closely related to variola, the etiological agent of smallpox. In humans, MPXV causes a disease similar to smallpox and is considered to be an emerging infectious disease. Moreover, the use of MPXV for bioterroristic/biowarfare activities is of significant concern. Available small animal models of human monkeypox have been restricted to mammals with poorly defined biologies that also have limited reagent availability. We have established a murine MPXV model utilizing the STAT1-deficient C57BL/6 mouse. Here we report that a relatively low-dose intranasal (IN) infection induces 100% mortality in the stat1(-)(/)(-) model by day 10 postinfection with high infectious titers in the livers, spleens, and lungs of moribund animals. Vaccination with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) followed by a booster vaccination is sufficient to protect against an intranasal MPXV challenge and induces an immune response more robust than that of a single vaccination. Furthermore, antiviral treatment with CMX001 (HDP-cidofovir) and ST-246 protects when administered as a regimen initiated on the day of infection. Thus, the stat1(-)(/)(-) model provides a lethal murine platform for evaluating therapeutics and for investigating the immunological and pathological responses to MPXV infection.	32	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.02012-09	Stabenow J, Buller RM, Schriewer J, West C, Sagartz JE, Parker S.

6207310	Monoclonal antibodies to a monkeypox virus polypeptide determinant	Three monkeypox virus (MPV) antibody-secreting murine monoclones were characterized as being of the immunoglobulin G1 isotype, gave a 4+ reaction in the indirect fluorescent-antibody test, gave a positive reaction in the enzyme immunoassay, and did not neutralize MPV. These monoclonal antibodies were determined by the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transblot method to react to a 15,500-molecular-weight MPV polypeptide. This reactivity could not be removed by adsorption to a vaccinia virus-infected cell suspension. The three monoclonal antibodies were specific for MPV when tested against epidemiologically unrelated isolates of cowpox virus, variola virus, vaccinia virus, and MPV.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.52.1.290-292.1984	Roumillat LF, Patton JL, Davis ML.

20667104	Gene expression profiling of monkeypox virus-infected cells reveals novel interfaces for host-virus interactions	Monkeypox virus (MPV) is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus and a potential biothreat agent that causes human disease with varying morbidity and mortality. Members of the Orthopoxvirus genus have been shown to suppress antiviral cell defenses, exploit host cell machinery, and delay infection-induced cell death. However, a comprehensive study of all host genes and virus-targeted host networks during infection is lacking. To better understand viral strategies adopted in manipulating routine host biology on global scale, we investigated the effect of MPV infection on Macaca mulatta kidney epithelial cells (MK2) using GeneChip rhesus macaque genome microarrays. Functional analysis of genes differentially expressed at 3 and 7 hours post infection showed distinctive regulation of canonical pathways and networks. While the majority of modulated histone-encoding genes exhibited sharp copy number increases, many of its transcription regulators were substantially suppressed; suggesting involvement of unknown viral factors in host histone expression. In agreement with known viral dependence on actin in motility, egress, and infection of adjacent cells, our results showed extensive regulation of genes usually involved in controlling actin expression dynamics. Similarly, a substantial ratio of genes contributing to cell cycle checkpoints exhibited concerted regulation that favors cell cycle progression in G1, S, G2 phases, but arrest cells in G2 phase and inhibits entry into mitosis. Moreover, the data showed that large number of infection-regulated genes is involved in molecular mechanisms characteristic of cancer canonical pathways. Interestingly, ten ion channels and transporters showed progressive suppression during the course of infection. Although the outcome of this unusual channel expression on cell osmotic homeostasis remains unknown, instability of cell osmotic balance and membrane potential has been implicated in intracellular pathogens egress. Our results highlight the role of histones, actin, cell cycle regulators, and ion channels in MPV infection, and propose these host functions as attractive research focal points in identifying novel drug intervention sites.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-7-173	Alkhalil A, Hammamieh R, Hardick J, Ichou MA, Jett M, Ibrahim S.

15021045	Zoonotic poxvirus infections in humans	Purpose of review: The 2003 USA monkeypox epidemic caused by imported African rodents, newly emergent poxvirus zoonoses in Brazil and the possible use of variola virus for biological warfare has led to renewed interest in poxviruses and anti-poxviral therapies. Increasing foreign travel and importation of exotic animal species increases the likelihood of poxvirus infections occurring outside their usual geographical range and diagnostic delay has important implications. The present review provides an overview of these rare zoonoses. Recent findings: Three genera of Poxviridae are known to cause human zoonoses: orthopoxviruses, parapoxviruses and yatapoxvirus. Most cases are occupational, sporadic and have few cutaneous lesions with low morbidity. The exception is monkeypox, similar to smallpox, with significant morbidity and childhood mortality. Molecular characterization using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and other methods provides accurate phylogenetic identification and suggests that a cowpox-like virus is the probable ancestor of variola and other zoonotic poxviruses. DNA genomic sequencing of the Brazilian Cantagalo and Araçatuba viruses shows a close relationship to vaccinia virus. Poxviruses have potential in cancer immunotherapy and their ability to evade host-cell immune responses may provide a basis for new antipoxvirus therapies. Other agents, particularly nucleoside phosphonates such as cidofovir, show therapeutic action against poxviruses. Summary: Human zoonotic poxvirus infections are rare but increasingly encountered outside their usual geographical range. The 2003 USA monkeypox outbreak emphasizes the importance of early accurate diagnosis, particularly because increasing numbers of immunosuppressed individuals increases the potential for severe or fatal infections. PCR methodology enables accurate phylogenetic typing and has identified new diseases, but rapid, reliable methods must be made available for clinicians. More research into therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of poxvirus infections is required.	39	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1097/00001432-200404000-00003	Lewis-Jones S.

20962097	Variola and monkeypox viruses utilize conserved mechanisms of virion motility and release that depend on abl and SRC family tyrosine kinases	Vaccinia virus (VacV) enters mammalian cells, replicates extranuclearly, and produces virions that move to the cell surface along microtubules, fuse with the plasma membrane, and move from infected cells toward apposing cells on actin-filled membranous protrusions or actin tails. To form actin tails, cell-associated enveloped virions (CEV) require Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, release of CEV from the cell requires Abl but not Src family tyrosine kinases and is blocked by imatinib mesylate (STI-571; Gleevec), an Abl family kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in humans. Here we demonstrate that the Poxviridae family members monkeypox virus (MPX) and variola virus (VarV) use conserved mechanisms for actin motility and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) release. Furthermore, we show that imatinib mesylate is effective in a mouse model of infection with VacV, whether delivered prophylactically or postinfection, and restricts spread of virions from the site of inoculation. While inhibitors of both Src and Abl family kinases, such as dasatinib (BMS-354825; Sprycel), are effective in limiting dissemination of VacV, VarV, and MPX in vitro, members of this class of drugs appear to have immunosuppressive effects in vivo that preclude their use as anti-infectives. Together, these data suggest a possible utility for imatinib mesylate in treating smallpox or MPX infections or complications associated with vaccination.	47	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.01814-10	Reeves PM, Smith SK, Olson VA, Thorne SH, Bornmann W, Damon IK, Kalman D.

6096036	The current status of human monkeypox: memorandum from a WHO meeting	In spite of a recent increase in the number of reported cases, human monkeypox remains a rare sporadic zoonotic disease with limited capacity to spread between humans. As such, the disease does not at present require specific public health measures. However, much of the population in the enzootic region, especially in the 5-14-year age group, still retains some immunity as a result of vaccination against smallpox. Continuation of surveillance activities on the same scale as at present until 1989 should provide a clear indication of the extent to which human monkeypox may be considered a public health problem, either generally or in particular localities. Such surveillance should also provide a definitive clinical and epidemiological picture of this newly discovered disease. Further research on its ecology and epidemiology will be facilitated by the development of a simple, specific and sensitive serological test for monkeypox virus-specific antibodies.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	[No authors listed]	Bull World Health Organ. 1984;62(5):703-13.
20111702	Comparison of West African and Congo Basin monkeypox viruses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice	Although monkeypox virus (MPXV) studies in wild rodents and non-human primates have generated important knowledge regarding MPXV pathogenesis and inferences about disease transmission, it might be easier to dissect the importance of virulence factors and correlates of protection to MPXV in an inbred mouse model. Herein, we compared the two clades of MPXV via two routes of infection in the BALB/c and C57BL/6 inbred mice strains. Our studies show that similar to previous animal studies, the Congo Basin strain of MPXV was more virulent than West African MPXV in both mouse strains as evidenced by clinical signs. Although animals did not develop lesions as seen in human MPX infections, localized signs were apparent with the foot pad route of inoculation, primarily in the form of edema at the site of inoculation; while the Congo Basin intranasal route of infection led to generalized symptoms, primarily weight loss. We have determined that future studies with MPXV and laboratory mice would be very beneficial in understanding the pathogenesis of MPXV, in particular if used in in vivo imaging studies. Although this mouse model may not suffice as a model of human MPX disease, with an appropriate inbred mouse model, we can unravel many unknown aspects of MPX pathogenesis, including virulence factors, disease progression in rodent hosts, and viral shedding from infected animals. In addition, such a model can be utilized to test antivirals and the next generation of orthopoxvirus vaccines for their ability to alter the course of disease.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0008912	Hutson CL, Abel JA, Carroll DS, Olson VA, Braden ZH, Hughes CM, Dillon M, Hopkins C, Karem KL, Damon IK, Osorio JE.

33517914	COVID-19 in comparison with other emerging viral diseases: risk of geographic spread via travel	Purpose of review: The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major global health threat. The rapid spread was facilitated by air travel although rigorous travel bans and lockdowns were able to slow down the spread. How does COVID-19 compare with other emerging viral diseases of the past two decades? Recent findings: Viral outbreaks differ in many ways, such as the individuals most at risk e.g. pregnant women for Zika and the elderly for COVID-19, their vectors of transmission, their fatality rate, and their transmissibility often measured as basic reproduction number. The risk of geographic spread via air travel differs significantly between emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 is not associated with the highest case fatality rate compared with other emerging viral diseases such as SARS and Ebola, but the combination of a high reproduction number, superspreading events and a globally immunologically naïve population has led to the highest global number of deaths in the past 20 decade compared to any other pandemic.	9	Review	Chikungunya; Dengue; Ebola; Japanese encephalitis; Measles; Monkeypox; SARS; West Nile encephalitis; Yellow fever; Zika	10.1186/s40794-020-00129-9	Wilder-Smith A.

23760373	Smallpox: can we still learn from the journey to eradication?	One of the most celebrated achievements of immunology and modern medicine is the eradication of the dreaded plague smallpox. From the introduction of smallpox vaccination by Edward Jenner, to its popularization by Louis Pasteur, to the eradication effort led by Donald Henderson, this story has many lessons for us today, including the characteristics of the disease and vaccine that permitted its eradication, and the obviousness of the vaccine as a vector for other intractable Infectious diseases. The disease itself, interpreted in the light of modern molecular immunology, is an obvious immunopathological disease, which occurs after a latent interval of 1-2 weeks, and manifests as a systemic cell-mediated delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) syndrome. The vaccine that slayed this dragon was given the name vaccinia, and was thought to have evolved from cowpox virus, but is now known to be most closely related to a poxvirus isolated from a horse. Of interest is the fact that of the various isolates of orthopox viruses, only variola, vaccinia and monkeypox viruses can infect humans. In contrast to the systemic disease of variola, vaccinia only replicates locally at the site of inoculation, and causes a localized DTH response that usually peaks after 7-10 days. This difference in the pathogenicity of variola vs. vaccinia is thought to be due to the capacity of variola to circumvent innate immunity, which allows it to disseminate widely before the adaptive immune response occurs. Thus, the fact that vaccinia virus is attenuated compared to variola, but is still replication competent, makes for its remarkable efficacy as a vaccine, as the localized infection activates all of the cells and molecules of both innate and adaptive immunity. Accordingly vaccinia itself, and not modified replication incompetent vaccina, is the hope for use as a vector in the eradication of additional pathogenic microbes from the globe.	6	Review	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Smith KA.

15078924	Smallpox DNA vaccine protects nonhuman primates against lethal monkeypox	Two decades after a worldwide vaccination campaign was used to successfully eradicate naturally occurring smallpox, the threat of bioterrorism has led to renewed vaccination programs. In addition, sporadic outbreaks of human monkeypox in Africa and a recent outbreak of human monkeypox in the U.S. have made it clear that naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxvirus diseases remain a public health concern. Much of the threat posed by orthopoxviruses could be eliminated by vaccination; however, because the smallpox vaccine is a live orthopoxvirus vaccine (vaccinia virus) administered to the skin, the vaccine itself can pose a serious health risk. Here, we demonstrate that rhesus macaques vaccinated with a DNA vaccine consisting of four vaccinia virus genes (L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R) were protected from severe disease after an otherwise lethal challenge with monkeypox virus. Animals vaccinated with a single gene (L1R) which encodes a target of neutralizing antibodies developed severe disease but survived. This is the first demonstration that a subunit vaccine approach to smallpox-monkeypox immunization is feasible.	105	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/jvi.78.9.4433-4443.2004	Hooper JW, Thompson E, Wilhelmsen C, Zimmerman M, Ichou MA, Steffen SE, Schmaljohn CS, Schmaljohn AL, Jahrling PB.

23658452	Assessment of the protective effect of Imvamune and Acam2000 vaccines against aerosolized monkeypox virus in cynomolgus macaques	To support the licensure of a new and safer vaccine to protect people against smallpox, a monkeypox model of infection in cynomolgus macaques, which simulates smallpox in humans, was used to evaluate two vaccines, Acam2000 and Imvamune, for protection against disease. Animals vaccinated with a single immunization of Imvamune were not protected completely from severe and/or lethal infection, whereas those receiving either a prime and boost of Imvamune or a single immunization with Acam2000 were protected completely. Additional parameters, including clinical observations, radiographs, viral load in blood, throat swabs, and selected tissues, vaccinia virus-specific antibody responses, immunophenotyping, extracellular cytokine levels, and histopathology were assessed. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the levels of neutralizing antibody in animals vaccinated with a single immunization of Acam2000 (132 U/ml) and the prime-boost Imvamune regime (69 U/ml) prior to challenge with monkeypox virus. After challenge, there was evidence of viral excretion from the throats of 2 of 6 animals in the prime-boost Imvamune group, whereas there was no confirmation of excreted live virus in the Acam2000 group. This evaluation of different human smallpox vaccines in cynomolgus macaques helps to provide information about optimal vaccine strategies in the absence of human challenge studies.	17	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.03481-12	Hatch GJ, Graham VA, Bewley KR, Tree JA, Dennis M, Taylor I, Funnell SG, Bate SR, Steeds K, Tipton T, Bean T, Hudson L, Atkinson DJ, McLuckie G, Charlwood M, Roberts AD, Vipond J.

22217169	Optimization of peptide-based ELISA for serological diagnostics: a retrospective study of human monkeypox infection	Although smallpox has been eradicated, other diseases caused by virulent orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox virus (MPV) remain endemic in remote areas of western and central sub-Saharan Africa, and represent a potential biothreat due to international travel and/or inadvertent exposure. Unfortunately, extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among orthopoxviruses presents a challenge to serological diagnosis. We previously reported a 20mer peptide-based ELISA that identified recent MPV infection with >90% sensitivity and >90% specificity. However, the sensitivity of this approach was not determined with samples obtained at later time points after antibody titers had declined from their peak levels. To improve assay sensitivity for detecting MPV-specific antibodies at later time points, we compared diagnostic 20mer peptides to 30mer peptides. In addition, optimal 30mer peptides were tested in combination or after conjugating selected peptides to a carrier protein (bovine serum albumin) to further improve assay performance. An optimized combination of four unconjugated 30mer peptides provided 100% sensitivity for detecting MPV infection at 2-6 months post-infection, 45% sensitivity for detecting MPV infection at >2 years post-infection, and 99% specificity. However, an optimized combination of two peptide conjugates provided 100% sensitivity for detecting MPV infection at 2-6 months post-infection, 90% sensitivity for detecting MPV infection at >2 years post-infection, and 97% specificity. Peptide-based ELISA tests provide a relatively simple approach for serological detection of MPV infection. Moreover, the systematic approach used here to optimize diagnostic peptide reagents is applicable to developing improved diagnostics to a broad range of other viruses, and may be particularly useful for distinguishing between closely-related viruses within the same genus or family.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1089/vbz.2011.0779	Dubois ME, Hammarlund E, Slifka MK.

21697474	Effective antiviral treatment of systemic orthopoxvirus disease: ST-246 treatment of prairie dogs infected with monkeypox virus	Smallpox preparedness research has led to development of antiviral therapies for treatment of serious orthopoxvirus infections. Monkeypox virus is an emerging, zoonotic orthopoxvirus which can cause severe and transmissible disease in humans, generating concerns for public health. Monkeypox virus infection results in a systemic, febrile-rash illness closely resembling smallpox. Currently, there are no small-molecule antiviral therapeutics approved to treat orthopoxvirus infections of humans. The prairie dog, using monkeypox virus as a challenge virus, has provided a valuable nonhuman animal model in which monkeypox virus infection closely resembles human systemic orthopoxvirus illness. Here, we assess the efficacy of the antiorthopoxvirus compound ST-246 in prairie dogs against a monkeypox virus challenge of 65 times the 50% lethal dose (LD(50)). Animals were infected intranasally and administered ST-246 for 14 days, beginning on days 0, 3, or after rash onset. Swab and blood samples were collected every 2 days and analyzed for presence of viral DNA by real-time PCR and for viable virus by tissue culture. Seventy-five percent of infected animals that received vehicle alone succumbed to infection. One hundred percent of animals that received ST-246 survived challenge, and animals that received treatment before symptom onset remained largely asymptomatic. Viable virus and viral DNA were undetected or at greatly reduced levels in animals that began treatment on 0 or 3 days postinfection, compared to control animals or animals treated post-rash onset. Animals treated after rash onset manifested illness, but all recovered. Our results indicate that ST-246 can be used therapeutically, following onset of rash illness, to treat systemic orthopoxvirus infections.	23	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.02173-10	Smith SK, Self J, Weiss S, Carroll D, Braden Z, Regnery RL, Davidson W, Jordan R, Hruby DE, Damon IK.

15325066	Emerging infections in animals--potential new zoonoses?	It is well recognized that most emerging diseases of humans are zoonotic, and that the forces working to create emerging diseases in humans are also operating in animal populations. However, what is often overlooked is that emerging human diseases are usually preceded by the emergence of the same pathogen in an animal population. In fact, the developing disease in animals acts as a link allowing the disease to take hold and wreck havoc in public health. Numerous examples--Rift Valley fever, monkeypox, Nipah, and Ebola--serve to underscore this linkage and to highlight the increasing interconnectedness of animal and human health.	6	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.cll.2004.05.001	Torres-Vélez F, Brown C.

18252104	Spectrum of infection and risk factors for human monkeypox, United States, 2003	For the 2003 monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak in the United States, interhuman transmission was not documented and all case-patients were near or handled MPXV-infected prairie dogs. We initiated a case-control study to evaluate risk factors for animal-to-human MPXV transmission. Participants completed a questionnaire requesting exposure, clinical, and demographic information. Serum samples were obtained for analysis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM to orthopoxvirus. When data were adjusted for smallpox vaccination, case-patients were more likely than controls to have had daily exposure to a sick animal (odds ratio [OR] 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-13.4), cleaned cages and bedding of a sick animal (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.4-20.7), or touched a sick animal (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.2-13.4). These findings demonstrate that human MPXV infection is associated with handling of MPXV-infected animals and suggest that exposure to excretions and secretions of infected animals can result in infection.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1309.070175	Reynolds MG, Davidson WB, Curns AT, Conover CS, Huhn G, Davis JP, Wegner M, Croft DR, Newman A, Obiesie NN, Hansen GR, Hays PL, Pontones P, Beard B, Teclaw R, Howell JF, Braden Z, Holman RC, Karem KL, Damon IK.

11384521	Outbreak of human monkeypox, Democratic Republic of Congo, 1996 to 1997	Human monkeypox is a zoonotic smallpox-like disease caused by an orthopoxvirus of interhuman transmissibility too low to sustain spread in susceptible populations. In February 1997, 88 cases of febrile pustular rash were identified for the previous 12 months in 12 villages of the Katako-Kombe Health Zone, Democratic Republic of Congo (attack rate = 22 per 1,000; case-fatality rate = 3.7%). Seven were active cases confirmed by virus isolation. Orthopoxvirus- neutralizing antibodies were detected in 54% of 72 patients who provided serum and 25% of 59 wild-caught animals, mainly squirrels. Hemagglutination-inhibition assays and Western blotting detected antibodies in 68% and 73% of patients, respectively. Vaccinia vaccination, which protects against monkeypox, ceased by 1983 after global smallpox eradication, leading to an increase in the proportion of susceptible people.	92	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid0703.010311	Hutin YJ, Williams RJ, Malfait P, Pebody R, Loparev VN, Ropp SL, Rodriguez M, Knight JC, Tshioko FK, Khan AS, Szczeniowski MV, Esposito JJ.

15951823	Smallpox vaccine-induced antibodies are necessary and sufficient for protection against monkeypox virus	Vaccination with live vaccinia virus affords long-lasting protection against variola virus, the agent of smallpox. Its mode of protection in humans, however, has not been clearly defined. Here we report that vaccinia-specific B-cell responses are essential for protection of macaques from monkeypox virus, a variola virus ortholog. Antibody-mediated depletion of B cells, but not CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, abrogated vaccine-induced protection from a lethal intravenous challenge with monkeypox virus. In addition, passive transfer of human vaccinia-neutralizing antibodies protected nonimmunized macaques from severe disease. Thus, vaccines able to induce long-lasting protective antibody responses may constitute realistic alternatives to the currently available smallpox vaccine (Dryvax).	136	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/nm1261	Edghill-Smith Y, Golding H, Manischewitz J, King LR, Scott D, Bray M, Nalca A, Hooper JW, Whitehouse CA, Schmitz JE, Reimann KA, Franchini G.

23935820	Pathogen-host associations and predicted range shifts of human monkeypox in response to climate change in central Africa	Climate change is predicted to result in changes in the geographic ranges and local prevalence of infectious diseases, either through direct effects on the pathogen, or indirectly through range shifts in vector and reservoir species. To better understand the occurrence of monkeypox virus (MPXV), an emerging Orthopoxvirus in humans, under contemporary and future climate conditions, we used ecological niche modeling techniques in conjunction with climate and remote-sensing variables. We first created spatially explicit probability distributions of its candidate reservoir species in Africa's Congo Basin. Reservoir species distributions were subsequently used to model current and projected future distributions of human monkeypox (MPX). Results indicate that forest clearing and climate are significant driving factors of the transmission of MPX from wildlife to humans under current climate conditions. Models under contemporary climate conditions performed well, as indicated by high values for the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), and tests on spatially randomly and non-randomly omitted test data. Future projections were made on IPCC 4(th) Assessment climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2080, ranging from more conservative to more aggressive, and representing the potential variation within which range shifts can be expected to occur. Future projections showed range shifts into regions where MPX has not been recorded previously. Increased suitability for MPX was predicted in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Models developed here are useful for identifying areas where environmental conditions may become more suitable for human MPX; targeting candidate reservoir species for future screening efforts; and prioritizing regions for future MPX surveillance efforts.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0066071	Thomassen HA, Fuller T, Asefi-Najafabady S, Shiplacoff JA, Mulembakani PM, Blumberg S, Johnston SC, Kisalu NK, Kinkela TL, Fair JN, Wolfe ND, Shongo RL, LeBreton M, Meyer H, Wright LL, Muyembe JJ, Buermann W, Okitolonda E, Hensley LE, Lloyd-Smith JO, Smith TB, Rimoin AW.

183908	Susceptibility of some rodent species to monkeypox virus, and course of the infection	The authors studied the susceptibility of five species of rodent to monkeypox virus inoculated by various routes and the course of the infection. Reactions varied from complete resistance to lethal generalized infection with rash. Rabbits and white mice appeared to be the most susceptible species and young animals were more susceptible than adults. Monkeypox virus was found to infect young animals by natural routes, i.e., per os and intranasally. Transmission by contact occurred among 10-day-old rabbits. Since antibodies to monkeypox virus may persist for over a year in the sera of convalescent animals, serological examination of animals is recommended for studying the ecology of this virus.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Marennikova SS, Seluhina EM.

14639375	Tropical dermatology: viral tropical diseases	Viruses are important pathogens in tropical areas; most of them, especially the tropical hemorrhagic fevers, produce mucocutaneous manifestations. More than any other kind of pathogen, viruses have the possibility for being widespread, since they have a greater probability of mutation than do bacteria, can cross species barriers easily, and infect both human beings and animals in habitats with a great biodiversity. Tropical habitats also have been subject to major ecologic changes in the last few decades, exposing humans to direct contact with these viruses and allowing hemorrhagic fevers due to new emergent viruses such as flaviviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses, and hantaviruses to become major threats to public health. The collapse of eradication programs in many countries, as well as population increases and ecologic modifications, have led to the spread of dengue and yellow fever to large portions of the world owing to the dissemination of vectors, especially mosquitoes, with broad ecologic ranges. Viruses previously restricted to some geographic areas, such as Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, and monkeypox are now affecting new countries and populations. Other viruses such as herpes B infection often affect travelers and animal handlers in most parts of the world. Dermatologic lesions occur in all these diseases and can facilitate a rapid diagnosis, leading to control of the virus and helping prevent possible outbreaks.	2	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0190-9622(03)02727-0	Lupi O, Tyring SK.

16914972	The evolving epidemiology of viral encephalitis	Purpose of review: The introduction of West Nile virus to North America illustrates the potential emergence of novel encephalitic agents in unexpected settings. There has been continued recognition of emerging neurotropic viruses in both the developed and developing world and novel modes of transmission of these agents. This review describes recent developments in the epidemiology of West Nile virus and several other emerging viral encephalitides in the developed and developing world and the emergence of novel mechanisms of transmitting viral encephalitis. Recent findings: West Nile virus has continued to have a large public health impact in North America. Improvements in blood donor screening have decreased transfusion-associated transmission of the virus. Monkeypox, with associated encephalitis, occurred in the US. Chandipura virus, an infrequently recognized rhabdovirus, was attributed to large outbreaks of viral encephalitis; however, compelling evidence suggests that the relationship of illness and the virus are questionable. Recent cases of transfusion-associated and transplant-associated viral encephalitis, including West Nile virus, rabies virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, were described. Summary: Continued West Nile virus activity in North America reinforces the fact that viruses can emerge and thrive in new environments and unexpected settings and suggests the need for continued surveillance. Transfusion-associated and transplant-associated viral encephalitis may be an underrecognized risk of these procedures.	7	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1097/01.wco.0000236613.74462.4c	Sejvar JJ.

29204136	Suppression of Poxvirus Replication by Resveratrol	Poxviruses continue to cause serious diseases even after eradication of the historically deadly infectious human disease, smallpox. Poxviruses are currently being developed as vaccine vectors and cancer therapeutic agents. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol stilbenoid found in plants that has been shown to inhibit or enhance replication of a number of viruses, but the effect of resveratrol on poxvirus replication is unknown. In the present study, we found that resveratrol dramatically suppressed the replication of vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypic member of poxviruses, in various cell types. Resveratrol also significantly reduced the replication of monkeypox virus, a zoonotic virus that is endemic in Western and Central Africa and causes human mortality. The inhibitory effect of resveratrol on poxviruses is independent of VACV N1 protein, a potential resveratrol binding target. Further experiments demonstrated that resveratrol had little effect on VACV early gene expression, while it suppressed VACV DNA synthesis, and subsequently post-replicative gene expression.	5	Information Unavailable	DNA synthesis; antiviral; gene expression; monkeypox; poxvirus; resveratrol; vaccinia virus	10.3389/fmicb.2017.02196	Cao S, Realegeno S, Pant A, Satheshkumar PS, Yang Z.

16002637	characterization of acute-phase humoral immunity to monkeypox: use of immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of monkeypox infection during the 2003 North American outbreak	A monkeypox outbreak occurred in the United States in 2003. Patient's sera were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a part of outbreak response measures. Clinical and epidemiologic information was abstracted from the case investigation forms. Serum samples from patients were tested by using an immunoglobulin M (IgM)-capture and an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA against Orthopoxvirus antigen. The detection of antiviral IgG and IgM antibodies and the kinetics of the antiviral IgG and IgM antibody responses were evaluated. Patients were classified as confirmed, probable, or suspect cases or were excluded as cases based on laboratory test results and epidemiologic and clinical criteria. A total of 37 confirmed case patients with monkeypox were identified, and 116 patients were excluded as case patients based on molecular testing or insufficient epidemiology and clinical data to warrant classification as a suspect or probable case. Of 37 confirmed case patients, 36 had a known history (presence or absence) of smallpox vaccination. Of those, 29 of the 36 either had or developed an IgG response, while 34 of the 36 developed an IgM response, regardless of vaccination status. Serum collected > or =5 days for IgM detection or serum collected > or =8 days after rash onset for IgG detection was most efficient for the detection of monkeypox virus infection. IgM ELISA detects recent infection with orthopoxviruses and, in this case, recent infection with monkeypox virus. In addition, analysis of paired sera for IgG and IgM detected seroconversion, another indicator of recent infection. The ELISA results correlated with the virologic PCR and viral culture results, indicating its diagnostic capabilities for monkeypox and potentially other orthopoxvirus infections due to zoonotic transmission or bioterrorism events.	42	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/CDLI.12.7.867-872.2005	Karem KL, Reynolds M, Braden Z, Lou G, Bernard N, Patton J, Damon IK.

16358743	[Comparative study of variola virus and monkeypox virus interferon-gamma-binding]	DNA fragments containing genes for coding IFN-gamma-binding proteins (IFNgammaBPs) of variola virus (VARV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV) were obtained from viral genomes using PCR. Isolated genes coding desired proteins were expressed in the insect Sf21 cells using baculovirus expression system. Secreted recombinant IFNgammaBPs were isolated from culture medium of infected Sf21 cells through affinity chromatography procedure. SDS-PAAG and Western blot analysis of culture medium of infected insect cells and preparations of purified recombinant IFNgammaBPs indicated that recombinant viral proteins were dimerized even in the absence of ligand (hIFNgamma) unlike their cell (eucaryotic) analogs. Biological activity of the recombinant IFNgammaBPs were studied in the test of protective effect inhibition of hIFNgamma on L68 cells infected with murine encephalomyocarditis virus. It was shown that recombinant IFNgammaBPs had dose-dependent IFNgamma-inhibiting activity. A possibility of the elaboration of new therapeutics for anti-hIFNgamma therapy on the base of IFNgammaBPs is discussed.

17426184	Monkeypox zoonotic associations: insights from laboratory evaluation of animals associated with the multi-state US outbreak	At the onset of the 2003 US monkeypox outbreak, virologic data were unavailable regarding which animal species were involved with virus importation and/or subsequent transmission to humans and whether there was a risk for establishment of zoonotic monkeypox in North America. Similarly, it was unclear which specimens would be best for virus testing. Monkeypox DNA was detected in at least 33 animals, and virus was cultured from 22. Virus-positive animals included three African species associated with the importation event (giant pouched rats, Cricetomys spp.; rope squirrels, Funisciuris sp.; and dormice, Graphiuris sp.). Virologic evidence from North American prairie dogs (Cynomys sp.) was concordant with their suspected roles as vectors for human monkeypox. Multiple tissues were found suitable for DNA detection and/or virus isolation. These data extend the potential host range for monkeypox virus infection and supports concern regarding the potential for establishment in novel reservoir species and ecosystems.	57	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Hutson CL, Lee KN, Abel J, Carroll DS, Montgomery JM, Olson VA, Li Y, Davidson W, Hughes C, Dillon M, Spurlock P, Kazmierczak JJ, Austin C, Miser L, Sorhage FE, Howell J, Davis JP, Reynolds MG, Braden Z, Karem KL, Damon IK, Regnery RL.

19740988	Expansion, reexpansion, and recall-like expansion of Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells in smallpox vaccination and monkeypox virus infection	Little is known about the in vivo kinetics of T-cell responses in smallpox/monkeypox. We showed that macaque Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells underwent 3-week-long expansion after smallpox vaccine immunization and displayed simple reexpansion in association with sterile anti-monkeypox virus (anti-MPV) immunity after MPV challenge. Virus-activated Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells exhibited gamma interferon-producing effector function after phosphoantigen stimulation. Surprisingly, like alphabeta T cells, suboptimally primed Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells in vaccinia virus/cidofovir-covaccinated macaques mounted major recall-like expansion after MPV challenge. Finally, Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells localized in inflamed lung tissues for potential regulation. Our studies provide the first in vivo evidence that viruses, despite their inability to produce exogenous phosphoantigen, can induce expansion, reexpansion, and recall-like expansion of Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells and stimulate their antimicrobial cytokine response.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00689-09	Shao L, Huang D, Wei H, Wang RC, Chen CY, Shen L, Zhang W, Jin J, Chen ZW.

21267444	Stunned silence: gene expression programs in human cells infected with monkeypox or vaccinia virus	Poxviruses use an arsenal of molecular weapons to evade detection and disarm host immune responses. We used DNA microarrays to investigate the gene expression responses to infection by monkeypox virus (MPV), an emerging human pathogen, and Vaccinia virus (VAC), a widely used model and vaccine organism, in primary human macrophages, primary human fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Even as the overwhelmingly infected cells approached their demise, with extensive cytopathic changes, their gene expression programs appeared almost oblivious to poxvirus infection. Although killed (gamma-irradiated) MPV potently induced a transcriptional program characteristic of the interferon response, no such response was observed during infection with either live MPV or VAC. Moreover, while the gene expression response of infected cells to stimulation with ionomycin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or poly (I-C) was largely unimpaired by infection with MPV, a cluster of pro-inflammatory genes were a notable exception. Poly(I-C) induction of genes involved in alerting the innate immune system to the infectious threat, including TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and beta, CCL5 and IL-6, were suppressed by infection with live MPV. Thus, MPV selectively inhibits expression of genes with critical roles in cell-signaling pathways that activate innate immune responses, as part of its strategy for stealthy infection.	25	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0015615	Rubins KH, Hensley LE, Relman DA, Brown PO.

15498157	Experimental infection of ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) with monkeypox virus	A proposed new small-animal (rodent) model for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of severe orthopoxvirus infections is described. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) were infected intraperitoneally and intranasally with monkeypox virus (MPXV). A fulminant illness developed in all animals, and they died 6-9 days after infection. Virus was cultured from the blood and oropharynx several days before death; at necropsy, all of the organs tested contained relatively high titers of MPXV. The major pathologic findings were in the liver, which showed centrilobular necrosis, steatosis, and basophilic inclusion bodies in hepatocytes. Splenic necrosis was also observed, as well as interstitial inflammation in the lungs. The pathologic features of MPXV in ground squirrels are similar to that described with MPXV in macaques and severe variola (smallpox) virus infection in humans.	28	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1009.040310	Tesh RB, Watts DM, Sbrana E, Siirin M, Popov VL, Xiao SY.

23408990	Transmissibility of the monkeypox virus clades via respiratory transmission: investigation using the prairie dog-monkeypox virus challenge system	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is endemic within Africa where it sporadically is reported to cause outbreaks of human disease. In 2003, an outbreak of human MPXV occurred in the US after the importation of infected African rodents. Since the eradication of smallpox (caused by an orthopoxvirus (OPXV) related to MPXV) and cessation of routine smallpox vaccination (with the live OPXV vaccinia), there is an increasing population of people susceptible to OPXV diseases. Previous studies have shown that the prairie dog MPXV model is a functional animal model for the study of systemic human OPXV illness. Studies with this model have demonstrated that infected animals are able to transmit the virus to naive animals through multiple routes of exposure causing subsequent infection, but were not able to prove that infected animals could transmit the virus exclusively via the respiratory route. Herein we used the model system to evaluate the hypothesis that the Congo Basin clade of MPXV is more easily transmitted, via respiratory route, than the West African clade. Using a small number of test animals, we show that transmission of viruses from each of the MPXV clade was minimal via respiratory transmission. However, transmissibility of the Congo Basin clade was slightly greater than West African MXPV clade (16.7% and 0% respectively). Based on these findings, respiratory transmission appears to be less efficient than those of previous studies assessing contact as a mechanism of transmission within the prairie dog MPXV animal model.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0055488	Hutson CL, Gallardo-Romero N, Carroll DS, Clemmons C, Salzer JS, Nagy T, Hughes CM, Olson VA, Karem KL, Damon IK.

18077063	Clonal vaccinia virus grown in cell culture fully protects monkeys from lethal monkeypox challenge	The potential use of smallpox as an agent of bioterrorism has renewed interest in the development of a modern vaccine capable of replacing the standard Dryvax vaccine. Vaccinia virus (ACAM2000), clonally isolated from Dryvax and manufactured in cell culture, was tested for immunogenicity and protective activity in a non-human primate model. Cynomolgus monkeys vaccinated with ACAM2000, Dryvax, or ACAM2000 diluent (control) were challenged 2 months post-vaccination with a lethal, intravenous dose of monkeypox virus. ACAM2000 proved immunogenic and efficacious in protecting against lethal monkeypox challenge, as evident from a lack of post-challenge viral replication, and the absence of any significant clinical signs attributable to monkeypox infection. This protection correlated (with) neutralizing antibody titers equivalent to those generated in the Dryvax group post-vaccination, as well as a similar significant increase in the presence of neutralizing antibodies post-challenge. Control animals showed no signs of vaccine-induced seroconversion, displayed post-challenge tissue-associated viral replication and viremia, and developed severe monkeypox-specific clinical symptoms. The protective efficacy of ACAM2000 was found to be equivalent to the currently approved vaccine, Dryvax.	21	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.10.063	Marriott KA, Parkinson CV, Morefield SI, Davenport R, Nichols R, Monath TP.

24246742	Enhancing health care worker ability to detect and care for patients with monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	Background: Monkeypox (MPX) is an endemic disease of public health importance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In 2010, the DRC Ministry of Health joined with external partners to improve MPX surveillance in the Tshuapa Health District of DRC. A pivotal component of the program is training of health zone personnel in surveillance methods and patient care. In this report we evaluate outcomes of the training program. Methods: Health care worker knowledge of key concepts in the MPX training curriculum was assessed using an anonymous self-administered survey. Additionally, evaluators collected feedback about the capacity of participants to perform the surveillance tasks. Training impacts were determined by assessing various surveillance performance metrics. Results: Correct trainee responses to questions about MPX symptoms and patient care increased significantly upon completion of training events. During the 12 months after the initial training, the proportion of suspected cases investigated increased significantly (from 6.7 to 37.3%), as compared to the 5 months prior. However, the proportion of reported cases that were ultimately confirmed remained unchanged, 20.1% (5/24) vs 23.3% (60/257). Conclusions: We have demonstrated that the MPX curriculum developed for this initiative was effective in transferring knowledge and was associated with improved detection of human MPX cases.	13	Information Unavailable	Monkeypox; PCR; Surveillance; Training evaluation; Zoonosis	10.1093/inthealth/iht029	Bass J, Tack DM, McCollum AM, Kabamba J, Pakuta E, Malekani J, Nguete B, Monroe BP, Doty JB, Karhemere S, Damon IK, Balilo M, Okitolonda E, Shongo RL, Reynolds MG.

15633096	Smallpox vaccine does not protect macaques with AIDS from a lethal monkeypox virus challenge	It is unknown whether smallpox vaccination would protect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals, because helper CD4(+) cells, the targets of HIV-1 infection, are necessary for the induction of both adaptive CD8(+) cell and B cell responses. We have addressed this question in macaques and have demonstrated that, although smallpox vaccination is safe in immunodeficient macaques when it is preceded by immunization with highly attenuated vaccinia strains, the macaques were not protected against lethal monkeypox virus challenge if their CD4(+) cell count was <300 cells/mm(3). The lack of protection appeared to be associated with a defect in vaccinia-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) switching from IgM to IgG. Thus, vaccination strategies that bypass CD4(+) cell help are needed to elicit IgG antibodies with high affinity and adequate tissue distribution and to restore protection against smallpox in severely immunocompromised individuals.	27	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1086/427265	Edghill-Smith Y, Bray M, Whitehouse CA, Miller D, Mucker E, Manischewitz J, King LR, Robert-Guroff M, Hryniewicz A, Venzon D, Meseda C, Weir J, Nalca A, Livingston V, Wells J, Lewis MG, Huggins J, Zwiers SH, Golding H, Franchini G.

15919938	Modified vaccinia virus Ankara protects macaques against respiratory challenge with monkeypox virus	The use of classical smallpox vaccines based on vaccinia virus (VV) is associated with severe complications in both naive and immune individuals. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a highly attenuated replication-deficient strain of VV, has been proven to be safe in humans and immunocompromised animals, and its efficacy against smallpox is currently being addressed. Here we directly compare the efficacies of MVA alone and in combination with classical VV-based vaccines in a cynomolgus macaque monkeypox model. The MVA-based smallpox vaccine protected macaques against a lethal respiratory challenge with monkeypox virus and is therefore an important candidate for the protection of humans against smallpox.	77	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.79.12.7845-7851.2005	Stittelaar KJ, van Amerongen G, Kondova I, Kuiken T, van Lavieren RF, Pistoor FH, Niesters HG, van Doornum G, van der Zeijst BA, Mateo L, Chaplin PJ, Osterhaus AD.

9779620	Specific detection of monkeypox virus by polymerase chain reaction	The open reading frame coding for the A-type inclusion body protein (ATI) of monkeypox virus (MPV) was identified and sequenced for two strains. Nucleotide sequence comparison revealed 72-95.3% homology with the reported open reading frame sequences of the ATIs of other orthopoxvirus species, such as variola, vaccinia, cowpox, ectromelia, and camelpox viruses. Each MPV strain contained an 8-bp deletion, which caused a frameshift that introduced a premature stop in the open reading frame at base 2091 relative to the ATI open reading frame of cowpox virus strain Brighton. The sequences enabled a primer pair to be designed that flanked the deletion and specifically amplified a 601-bp fragment that identified and differentiated 19 MPV strains examined from five other Old World orthopoxvirus species examined. The specificity was confirmed by cleavage of the 19 MPV strain amplicons with BglII, which produced three subfragments of expected sized, based on the determined MPV sequences.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0166-0934(98)00099-8	Neubauer H, Reischl U, Ropp S, Esposito JJ, Wolf H, Meyer H.

26319072	Recent advances in the study of live attenuated cell-cultured smallpox vaccine LC16m8	LC16m8 is a live, attenuated, cell-cultured smallpox vaccine that was developed and licensed in Japan in the 1970s, but was not used in the campaign to eradicate smallpox. In the early 2000s, the potential threat of bioterrorism led to reconsideration of the need for a smallpox vaccine. Subsequently, LC16m8 production was restarted in Japan in 2002, requiring re-evaluation of its safety and efficacy. Approximately 50,000 children in the 1970s and about 3500 healthy adults in the 2000s were vaccinated with LC16m8 in Japan, and 153 adults have been vaccinated with LC16m8 or Dryvax in phase I/II clinical trials in the USA. These studies confirmed the safety and efficacy of LC16m8, while several studies in animal models have shown that LC16m8 protects the host against viral challenge. The World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommended LC16m8, together with ACAM2000, as a stockpile vaccine in 2013. In addition, LC16m8 is expected to be a viable alternative to first-generation smallpox vaccines to prevent human monkeypox.	6	Review	Anti-terrorism; LC16m8; Monkeypox; Smallpox vaccine	10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.07.111	Eto A, Saito T, Yokote H, Kurane I, Kanatani Y.

12615299	Potential antiviral therapeutics for smallpox, monkeypox and other orthopoxvirus infections	We assessed the activities of 24 different antiviral compounds against smallpox (two strains of variola major and one of variola minor), monkeypox, vaccinia and cowpox viruses by a neutral red uptake assay. To establish assay parameters, we examined viral replication and its inhibition at various times postinfection and at several multiplicities of infection. Drugs were selected to target a range of functions involved in viral replication. Eight compounds (cidofovir, cyclic HPMPC (cHPMPC), HPMPA, ribavirin, tiazofurin, carbocyclic 3-deazaadenosine, 3-deazaneplanocin A and DFBA (1-(2,4-difluorobenzyloxy)adenosine perchlorate)-a derivative of adenosine N1-oxide) inhibited the replication of all three variola strains and the other orthopoxviruses at drug concentrations within a pharmacologically achievable range. Two others (methisazone and bis-POM-PMEA) showed a lesser degree of antiviral effect, while the remainder were inactive. To examine possible naturally occurring drug resistance among a large number of variola isolates obtained from different geographical regions and at different times, we examined the sensitivity of 35 different strains of variola as well as other orthopoxviruses to a subset of three of the most active compounds: cidofovir, cHPMPC, and ribavirin. Preliminary data indicate that nearly all isolates appear to have similar drug sensitivities. These findings are currently being verified and expanded.	60	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0166-3542(02)00196-1	Baker RO, Bray M, Huggins JW.

17070121	Properties of the recombinant TNF-binding proteins from variola, monkeypox, and cowpox viruses are different	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a potent proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine, is a critical extracellular immune regulator targeted by poxviruses through the activity of virus-encoded family of TNF-binding proteins (CrmB, CrmC, CrmD, and CrmE). The only TNF-binding protein from variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, infecting exclusively humans, is CrmB. Here we have aligned the amino acid sequences of CrmB proteins from 10 VARV, 14 cowpox virus (CPXV), and 22 monkeypox virus (MPXV) strains. Sequence analyses demonstrated a high homology of these proteins. The regions homologous to cd00185 domain of the TNF receptor family, determining the specificity of ligand-receptor binding, were found in the sequences of CrmB proteins. In addition, a comparative analysis of the C-terminal SECRET domain sequences of CrmB proteins was performed. The differences in the amino acid sequences of these domains characteristic of each particular orthopoxvirus species were detected. It was assumed that the species-specific distinctions between the CrmB proteins might underlie the differences in these physicochemical and biological properties. The individual recombinant proteins VARV-CrmB, MPXV-CrmB, and CPXV-CrmB were synthesized in a baculovirus expression system in insect cells and isolated. Purified VARV-CrmB was detectable as a dimer with a molecular weight of 90 kDa, while MPXV- and CPXV-CrmBs, as monomers when fractioned by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The CrmB proteins of VARV, MPXV, and CPXV differed in the efficiencies of inhibition of the cytotoxic effects of human, mouse, or rabbit TNFs in L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. Testing of CrmBs in the experimental model of LPS-induced shock using SPF BALB/c mice detected a pronounced protective effect of VARV-CrmB. Thus, our data demonstrated the difference in anti-TNF activities of VARV-, MPXV-, and CPXV-CrmBs and efficiency of VARV-CrmB rather than CPXV- or MPXV-CrmBs against LPS-induced mortality in mice.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.bbapap.2006.09.006	Gileva IP, Nepomnyashchikh TS, Antonets DV, Lebedev LR, Kochneva GV, Grazhdantseva AV, Shchelkunov SN.

34530009	A human recombinant analogue to plasma-derived vaccinia immunoglobulin prophylactically and therapeutically protects against lethal orthopoxvirus challenge	Orthopoxviruses such as variola and monkeypox viruses continue to threaten the human population. Monkeypox virus is endemic in central and western Africa and outbreaks have reached as far as the U.S. Although variola virus, the etiologic agent of smallpox, has been eradicated by a successful vaccination program, official and likely clandestine stocks of the virus exist. Moreover, studies with ectromelia virus (the etiological agent of mousepox) have revealed that IL-4 recombinant viruses are significantly more virulent than wild-type viruses even in mice treated with vaccines and/or antivirals. For these reasons, it is critical that antiviral modalities are developed to treat these viruses should outbreaks, or deliberate dissemination, occur. Currently, 2 antivirals (brincidofovir and tecovirimat) are in the U.S. stockpile allowing for emergency use of the drugs to treat smallpox. Both antivirals have advantages and disadvantages in a clinical and emergency setting. Here we report on the efficacy of a recombinant immunoglobulin (rVIG) that demonstrated efficacy against several orthopoxviruses in vitro and in vivo in both a prophylactic and therapeutic fashion. A single intraperitoneal injection of rVIG significantly protected mice when given up to 14 days before or as late as 6 days post challenge. Moreover, rVIG reduced morbidity, as measured by weight-change, as well as several previously established biomarkers of disease. In rVIG treated mice, we found that vDNA levels in blood were significantly reduced, as was ALT (a marker of liver damage) and infectious virus levels in the liver. No apparent adverse events were observed in rVIG treated mice, suggesting the immunoglobulin is well tolerated. These findings suggest that recombinant immunoglobulins could be candidates for further evaluation and possible licensure under the FDA Animal Rule.

6155223	A study of the specificities of sequential antisera to variola and monkeypox viruses by radioimmunoassay	The specificities of antisera during development of the humoral antibody response to poxvirus antigens were examined in monkeys injected with chimp-9 whitepox virus or monkeypox virus. Sera were obtained from 3 African green (vervet) monkeys inoculated with chimp-9 whitepox virus, 1 rhesus monkey inoculated with monkeypox virus, and 2 rhesus monkeys inoculated with soluble monkeypox viral antigen. The sequentially obtained sera from each animal were adsorbed with uninfected chicken chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) or vaccinia virus-infected CAM. The adsorbed sera were tested by radioimmunoassay to determine the specificity of the residual antibodies to vaccinia, variola, and monkeypox viruses. The adsorbed sera at different stages of the immune response showed increasing specificity with time after inoculation. Generally, antibodies in sera collected earlier than 21-27 days after immunization could not be identified after adsorption, but late sera could be identified unequivocally.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Walls HH, Ziegler DW, Nakano JH.

15119816	Monkeypox in the United States: an occupational health look at the first cases	Between May 15 and June 20, 2003, 71 suspected cases of monkeypox were investigated and 37 individuals in the United States developed laboratory confirmed monkeypox. These were the first cases of human monkeypox ever documented in the United States or in the Western Hemisphere. The disease was transmitted from small animals imported from Africa to other animals, including prairie dogs sold as pets throughout the U.S. Midwest. Direct contact with the infected animals was the method of infection, and although human to human transmission was thought to have occurred, this was not confirmed by follow up testing. Because of the link with contact with a prairie dog, initial evaluation of the disease was focused toward diseases commonly associated with this animal (e.g., tularemia, plague). Laboratory findings at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin pointed to the presence of an orthopox. The CDC confirmed monkeypox was the infecting orthopox agent. Occupational health nurses from the Marshfield Clinic had direct involvement in the identification and follow up of employees who had direct contact with the diagnosed patients. Programs, such as a respiratory protection program initiated and carried out by Clinic occupational health nurses, were used to prevent employee exposure for Clinic staff. One Clinic employee was thought to potentially have monkeypox because of her direct contact with one of the patients. Four Clinic employees were vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine as a result of their contact with patients or lab specimens. Quarantine of the potentially infected employee and her boyfriend uncovered issues that must be addressed if other infectious diseases requiring quarantine or isolation of individuals emerge or re-emerge. These include a system to compensate individuals in quarantine or isolation who do not have any other source of income. The issue of whether workers' compensation should cover an employee who is quarantined or isolated for a potential work related exposure to an infectious disease if no disease is actually diagnosed also needs to be explored. A better system of getting state or CDC laboratory results back to the local level, including the occupational health area of the generating facility, must be developed. This will be very important if diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or smallpox should re-emerge in the United States. Occupational health nurses are an integral part of any infectious disease process occurring in the United States. The identification of monkeypox in the United States shows that any planning to detect, prevent, and treat diseases with the potential to affect the employee population must include occupational health nurse involvement.	5	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Cunha BE.

12149352	Outbreaks of disease suspected of being due to human monkeypox virus infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2001	Seven outbreaks of disease characterized by a pustular rash and suspected to have been caused by human monkeypox virus were investigated. The outbreaks occurred between February and August 2001 in the province of Equateur in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The outbreaks involved a total of 31 persons and caused five deaths. Specimens from 14 patients were available and were analyzed by electron microscopy, virus isolation, and PCR assays specific for monkeypox virus and varicella-zoster virus. We provide evidence that two outbreaks were indeed caused by monkeypox virus (16 cases, with four deaths), that in two outbreaks both monkeypox and varicella-zoster virus were involved (seven cases, with one death), and that two outbreaks were cases of chickenpox caused by infection with varicella-zoster virus (six cases, with no deaths). In one outbreak, no evidence for either monkeypox or chickenpox was found (two cases, with no deaths).	45	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JCM.40.8.2919-2921.2002	Meyer H, Perrichot M, Stemmler M, Emmerich P, Schmitz H, Varaine F, Shungu R, Tshioko F, Formenty P.

18362406	Diagnosis and assessment of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection by quantitative PCR assay: differentiation of Congo Basin and West African MPXV strains	Human monkeypox, an infectious disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), is endemic to western and central Africa. A LightCycler quantitative PCR (LC-qPCR) system was developed for the diagnosis of this disease, targeting the A-type inclusion body gene (ATI gene) of MPXV. One naive monkey was infected with MPXV Zr-599 (Congo Basin strain) and one with MPXV Liberia (West African strain). Another three monkeys were immunized with smallpox vaccine on 0, 3, or 7 days, respectively, before infection with MPXV Zr-599. Peripheral blood cell (PBC) and throat swab (TS) specimens were serially collected. The LC-qPCR was validated for the diagnosis of monkeypox using virus isolation. Sequencing of the partial ATI gene revealed the insertion of a unique 453-nucleotide residue in the West African strains but not in the Congo Basin strains. Specific reverse primers for Congo Basin and West African strains were designed based on the unique sequence insertion. The LC-qPCR detected the MPXV genome, but not those of the other orthopoxviruses tested nor the varicella-zoster virus. Both the sensitivity and specificity of the LC-qPCR were over 90% in comparison to virus isolation when TS specimens were tested. Fourteen of the 15 virus isolation-positive PBC specimens showed positive reactions in the assay. Further, most PBC specimens collected from symptomatic monkeys in the later stage of illness showed positive reactions in the assay but negative reaction in virus isolation. It was possible to differentiate between these two groups with the LC-qPCR. Thus, the newly developed LC-qPCR is a useful and reliable diagnostic tool for MPXV infection.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Saijo M, Ami Y, Suzaki Y, Nagata N, Iwata N, Hasegawa H, Ogata M, Fukushi S, Mizutani T, Iizuka I, Sakai K, Sata T, Kurata T, Kurane I, Morikawa S.

16375715	Countermeasures to the bioterrorist threat of smallpox	"Variola, the agent of smallpox, is a bioterrorist threat, as is monkeypox virus, which also occurs naturally in Africa. Development of countermeasures, in the form of improved vaccines, antiviral drugs, and other therapeutic strategies are a high priority. Recent advances in molecular biology and in animal model development have provided fresh insight into the virulence determinants for smallpox and the pathophysiology of disease. The complex replication cycle for orthopoxviruses, and the pivotal role for viral-specific immunomodulatory proteins which contribute to escape from immunologic surveillance, provide many unique targets for therapeutic intervention. The ""toxemia"" of smallpox has been elucidated in part by variola-infected primate studies which revealed the central role of apoptosis and the evolution of a cytokine storm leading to hemorrhagic diathesis, resembling fulminent ""black"" smallpox. This suggests a potential role for therapeutic strategies developed for septic shock, in treatment of smallpox. Drugs licensed for other viruses which share molecular targets with orthopoxviruses (e.g. Cidofovir) or cancer drugs (e.g. Gleevec and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors) have immediate application for treatment of smallpox and monkeypox and provide leads for second generation drugs with higher therapeutic indices. Recent advances in identification of virulence determinants and immune evasion genes facilitate the design of alternative vaccines to replace live vaccinia strains that are unsuitable for a large proportion of individuals in a mass immunization campaign."	18	Review	Information Unavailable	10.2174/156652405774962326	Jahrling PB, Fritz EA, Hensley LE.

17255245	Comparative pathology of North American and central African strains of monkeypox virus in a ground squirrel model of the disease	The first human cases of monkeypox (MPX) were recognized in central Africa in 1970. Since then, sporadic outbreaks of the disease have occurred in central and west Africa. In 2003, an outbreak of human MPX occurred in the United States after importation of infected rodents from west Africa. Clinical features of the 2003 outbreak were less severe than accounts of the disease among people in central Africa. The reasons for this observed difference are unknown. In this study, the clinical and pathologic characteristics of experimental infection with representative central African and North American MPX virus strains were compared in a ground squirrel model of the disease. The results indicate that the US 2003 virus, which phylogenetically is a member of the west African MPX virus clade, was less virulent than central African MPX virus strains.	22	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Sbrana E, Xiao SY, Newman PC, Tesh RB.

20134011	Application of the Ibis-T5000 pan-Orthopoxvirus assay to quantitatively detect monkeypox viral loads in clinical specimens from macaques experimentally infected with aerosolized monkeypox virus	Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a member of the family Poxviridae and genus Orthopoxvirus, causes a smallpox-like disease in humans. A previously described pan-Orthopoxvirus assay, based on a broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS), was evaluated for its ability to detect MPXV from spiked human and aerosol-infected cynomolgous macaque (Macaca fascicularis) samples. Detection of MPXV DNA from macaque tissue, blood, and spiked human blood by the PCR/ESI-MS pan-Orthopoxvirus assay was comparable, albeit at slightly higher levels, to the current gold standard method of real-time PCR with the pan-Orthopoxvirus assay and had a limit of detection of 200 plaque-forming units. Furthermore, the platform was able to distinguish MPXV and vaccinia viruses that were spiked into macaque blood samples at various concentrations. This platform provides a new tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of orthopoxviral loads during vaccine or antiviral studies, but also could provide rapid identification during natural outbreaks or bioterrorism attacks.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0361	Grant RJ, Baldwin CD, Nalca A, Zoll S, Blyn LB, Eshoo MW, Matthews H, Sampath R, Whitehouse CA.

19004937	Coadministration of cidofovir and smallpox vaccine reduced vaccination side effects but interfered with vaccine-elicited immune responses and immunity to monkeypox	While the smallpox vaccine, Dryvax or Dryvax-derived ACAM2000, holds potential for public immunization against the spread of smallpox by bioterror, there is serious concern about Dryvax-mediated side effects. Here, we report that a single-dose vaccination regimen comprised of Dryvax and an antiviral agent, cidofovir, could reduce vaccinia viral loads after vaccination and significantly control Dryvax vaccination side effects. However, coadministration of cidofovir and Dryvax also reduced vaccine-elicited immune responses of antibody and T effector cells despite the fact that the reduced priming could be boosted as a recall response after monkeypox virus challenge. Evaluations of four different aspects of vaccine efficacy showed that coadministration of cidofovir and Dryvax compromised the Dryvax-induced immunity against monkeypox, although the covaccinated monkeys exhibited measurable protection against monkeypox compared to that of naïve controls. Thus, the single-dose coadministration of cidofovir and Dryvax effectively controlled vaccination side effects but significantly compromised vaccine-elicited immune responses and vaccine-induced immunity to monkeypox.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00984-08	Wei H, Huang D, Fortman J, Wang R, Shao L, Chen ZW.

21752919	Deletion of the monkeypox virus inhibitor of complement enzymes locus impacts the adaptive immune response to monkeypox virus in a nonhuman primate model of infection	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus closely related to variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. Human MPXV infection results in a disease that is similar to smallpox and can also be fatal. Two clades of MPXV have been identified, with viruses of the central African clade displaying more pathogenic properties than those within the west African clade. The monkeypox inhibitor of complement enzymes (MOPICE), which is not expressed by viruses of the west African clade, has been hypothesized to be a main virulence factor responsible for increased pathogenic properties of central African strains of MPXV. To gain a better understanding of the role of MOPICE during MPXV-mediated disease, we compared the host adaptive immune response and disease severity following intrabronchial infection with MPXV-Zaire (n = 4), or a recombinant MPXV-Zaire (n = 4) lacking expression of MOPICE in rhesus macaques (RM). Data presented here demonstrate that infection of RM with MPXV leads to significant viral replication in the peripheral blood and lungs and results in the induction of a robust and sustained adaptive immune response against the virus. More importantly, we show that the loss of MOPICE expression results in enhanced viral replication in vivo, as well as a dampened adaptive immune response against MPXV. Taken together, these findings suggest that MOPICE modulates the anti-MPXV immune response and that this protein is not the sole virulence factor of the central African clade of MPXV.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00199-11	Estep RD, Messaoudi I, O'Connor MA, Li H, Sprague J, Barron A, Engelmann F, Yen B, Powers MF, Jones JM, Robinson BA, Orzechowska BU, Manoharan M, Legasse A, Planer S, Wilk J, Axthelm MK, Wong SW.

20374968	Dosage comparison of Congo Basin and West African strains of monkeypox virus using a prairie dog animal model of systemic orthopoxvirus disease	The prairie dog is valuable for the study of monkeypox virus (MPXV) virulence and closely resembles human systemic orthopoxvirus disease. Herein, we utilize a variable dose intranasal challenge with approximately 10(3), 10(4), 10(5), and 10(6)PFU for each clade to further characterize virulence differences between the two MPXV clades. A trend of increased morbidity and mortality as well as greater viral shedding was observed with increasing viral challenge dose. Additionally, there appeared to be a delay in onset of disease for animals challenged with lower dosages of virus. Mathematical calculations were used to determine LD(50) values and based on these calculations, Congo Basin MPXV had approximately a hundred times lower LD(50) value than the West African clade (5.9x10(3) and 1.29x10(5) respectively); reinforcing previous findings that Congo Basin MPXV is more virulent.	25	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2010.03.012	Hutson CL, Carroll DS, Self J, Weiss S, Hughes CM, Braden Z, Olson VA, Smith SK, Karem KL, Regnery RL, Damon IK.

21148501	Multivalent smallpox DNA vaccine delivered by intradermal electroporation drives protective immunity in nonhuman primates against lethal monkeypox challenge	The threat of a smallpox-based bioterrorist event or a human monkeypox outbreak has heightened the importance of new, safe vaccine approaches for these pathogens to complement older poxviral vaccine platforms. As poxviruses are large, complex viruses, they present technological challenges for simple recombinant vaccine development where a multicomponent mixtures of vaccine antigens are likely important in protection. We report that a synthetic, multivalent, highly concentrated, DNA vaccine delivered by a minimally invasive, novel skin electroporation microarray can drive polyvalent immunity in macaques, and offers protection from a highly pathogenic monkeypox challenge. Such a diverse, high-titer antibody response produced against 8 different DNA-encoded antigens delivered simultaneously in microvolumes has not been previously described. These studies represent a significant improvement in the efficiency of the DNA vaccine platform, resulting in immune responses that mimic live viral infections, and would likely have relevance for vaccine design against complex human and animal pathogens.	38	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/infdis/jiq017	Hirao LA, Draghia-Akli R, Prigge JT, Yang M, Satishchandran A, Wu L, Hammarlund E, Khan AS, Babas T, Rhodes L, Silvera P, Slifka M, Sardesai NY, Weiner DB.

205632	The virion and soluble antigen proteins of variola, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses	The structural proteins in purified preparations of variola, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses were separated and compared by using a high resolution SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. About 30 proteins were resolved for each virus by autoradiography of longitudinally-sliced gel rods. Although the autoradioelectropherograms of each virus were similar, it was possible to differentiate them by their unique protein pattern in the 30,000 to 40,000 molecular weight region of the gels. A single virion glycoprotein (mol. wt. = 38 X 10(3)) and a virion phosphoprotein (mol. wt. = 12 X 10(3)) were associated with each of the virus preparations. Cross-absorbed monospecific immune sera against variola, monkeypox, and vaccinia virus-infected cells were used in immunodiffusion tests to precipitate radiolabeled, homologous, soluble antigen proteins. The predominant antigen protein associated with each immunospecific precipitate had a molecular weight of approximately 73,000.	5	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.1890010203	Esposito JJ, Obijeski JF, Nakano JH.

The different degree of inhibition was found among strains of those viruses, in which it was evident that five strains (CV-1, Lister, IHD, Dairen-I and Ikeda) of vaccinia viruses resulted in more reduced yields of infectious virus than four strains (Sen-19, Orang Utan, Copenhagen and Sierra Leone) of monkeypox viruses. There was also strain variation in BUdR sensitivity within vaccinia viruses but not in the case of monkeypox viruses.

16341204	Antiviral treatment is more effective than smallpox vaccination upon lethal monkeypox virus infection	There is concern that variola virus, the aetiological agent of smallpox, may be used as a biological weapon. For this reason several countries are now stockpiling (vaccinia virus-based) smallpox vaccine. Although the preventive use of smallpox vaccination has been well documented, little is known about its efficacy when used after exposure to the virus. Here we compare the effectiveness of (1) post-exposure smallpox vaccination and (2) antiviral treatment with either cidofovir (also called HPMPC or Vistide) or with a related acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue (HPMPO-DAPy) after lethal intratracheal infection of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with monkeypox virus (MPXV). MPXV causes a disease similar to human smallpox and this animal model can be used to measure differences in the protective efficacies of classical and new-generation candidate smallpox vaccines. We show that initiation of antiviral treatment 24 h after lethal intratracheal MPXV infection, using either of the antiviral agents and applying various systemic treatment regimens, resulted in significantly reduced mortality and reduced numbers of cutaneous monkeypox lesions. In contrast, when monkeys were vaccinated 24 h after MPXV infection, using a standard human dose of a currently recommended smallpox vaccine (Elstree-RIVM), no significant reduction in mortality was observed. When antiviral therapy was terminated 13 days after infection, all surviving animals had virus-specific serum antibodies and antiviral T lymphocytes. These data show that adequate preparedness for a biological threat involving smallpox should include the possibility of treating exposed individuals with antiviral compounds such as cidofovir or other selective anti-poxvirus drugs.	57	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/nature04295	Stittelaar KJ, Neyts J, Naesens L, van Amerongen G, van Lavieren RF, Holý A, De Clercq E, Niesters HG, Fries E, Maas C, Mulder PG, van der Zeijst BA, Osterhaus AD.

31240676	Preliminary Screening and In Vitro Confirmation of Orthopoxvirus Antivirals	The lack of antiviral drugs for the treatment of orthopoxvirus disease represents an unmet medical need, particularly due to the threat of variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) as an agent of biowarfare or bioterrorism (Henderson, 283:1279-1282, 1999). In addition to variola, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses are orthopoxviruses of concern to human health (Lewis-Jones, 17:81-89, 2004). Smallpox vaccination, using the closely related vaccinia virus, is no longer provided to the general public leading to a worldwide population increasingly susceptible not only to variola but to monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses as well. Orthopoxviruses share similar life cycles (Fenner et al., WHO, Geneva, 1988), and significant nucleotide and protein homology, and are immunologically cross-protective against other species within the genus, which was the basis of the highly successful vaccinia virus vaccine. These similarities also serve as the basis for screening for antivirals for dangerous pathogens such as variola and monkeypox virus using generally safer viruses such as cowpox and vaccinia. Methods for preliminary screening and initial characterization of potential orthopoxvirus antivirals in vitro, using vaccinia virus as a relatively safe surrogate for more pathogenic orthopoxviruses, are described herein. They include candidate identification in a viral cytopathic effect (CPE) assay as well as evaluation of the antiviral activity in inhibition assays to determine mean effective (or inhibitory) concentrations (EC50 or IC50). These assays were utilized in the identification and early characterization of tecovirimat (ST-246) (Yang et al., 79:13,139-13,149, 2005). These initial steps in identifying and characterizing the antiviral activity should be followed up with additional in vitro studies including specificity testing (for other orthopoxviruses and against other viruses), single-cycle growth curves, time of addition assays, cytotoxicity testing, and identification of the drug target.

23577120	Poxvirus antigen staining of immune cells as a biomarker to predict disease outcome in monkeypox and cowpox virus infection in non-human primates	Infection of non-human primates (NHPs) such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with monkeypox virus (MPXV) or cowpox virus (CPXV) serve as models to study poxvirus pathogenesis and to evaluate vaccines and anti-orthopox therapeutics. Intravenous inoculation of macaques with high dose of MPXV (>1-2×10(7) PFU) or CPXV (>10(2) PFU) results in 80% to 100% mortality and 66 to 100% mortality respectively. Here we report that NHPs with positive detection of poxvirus antigens in immune cells by flow cytometric staining, especially in monocytes and granulocytes succumbed to virus infection and that early positive pox staining is a strong predictor for lethality. Samples from four independent studies were analyzed. Eighteen NHPs from three different experiments were inoculated with two different MPXV strains at lethal doses. Ten NHPs displayed positive pox-staining and all 10 NHPs reached moribund endpoint. In contrast, none of the three NHPs that survived anticipated lethal virus dose showed apparent virus staining in the monocytes and granulocytes. In addition, three NHPs that were challenged with a lethal dose of MPXV and received cidofovir treatment were pox-antigen negative and all three NHPs survived. Furthermore, data from a CPXV study also demonstrated that 6/9 NHPs were pox-antigen staining positive and all 6 NHPs reached euthanasia endpoint, while the three survivors were pox-antigen staining negative. Thus, we conclude that monitoring pox-antigen staining in immune cells can be used as a biomarker to predict the prognosis of virus infection. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms and implications of the pox-infection of immune cells and the correlation between pox-antigen detection in immune cells and disease progression in human poxviral infection.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0060533	Song H, Janosko K, Johnson RF, Qin J, Josleyn N, Jett C, Byrum R, St Claire M, Dyall J, Blaney JE, Jennings G, Jahrling PB.

22205724	Systems kinomics demonstrates Congo Basin monkeypox virus infection selectively modulates host cell signaling responses as compared to West African monkeypox virus	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is comprised of two clades: Congo Basin MPXV, with an associated case fatality rate of 10%, and Western African MPXV, which is associated with less severe infection and minimal lethality. We thus postulated that Congo Basin and West African MPXV would differentially modulate host cell responses and, as many host responses are regulated through phosphorylation independent of transcription or translation, we employed systems kinomics with peptide arrays to investigate these functional host responses. Using this approach we have demonstrated that Congo Basin MPXV infection selectively down-regulates host responses as compared with West African MPXV, including growth factor- and apoptosis-related responses. These results were confirmed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis demonstrating that West African MPXV infection resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis in human monocytes as compared with Congo Basin MPXV. Further, differentially phosphorylated kinases were identified through comparison of our MPXV data sets and validated as potential targets for pharmacological inhibition of Congo Basin MPXV infection, including increased Akt S473 phosphorylation and decreased p53 S15 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt S473 phosphorylation resulted in a significant decrease in Congo Basin MPXV virus yield (261-fold) but did not affect West African MPXV. In addition, treatment with staurosporine, an apoptosis activator resulted in a 49-fold greater decrease in Congo Basin MPXV yields as compared with West African MPXV. Thus, using a systems kinomics approach, our investigation demonstrates that West African and Congo Basin MPXV differentially modulate host cell responses and has identified potential host targets of therapeutic interest.	19	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1074/mcp.M111.015701	Kindrachuk J, Arsenault R, Kusalik A, Kindrachuk KN, Trost B, Napper S, Jahrling PB, Blaney JE.

19223621	ST-246 antiviral efficacy in a nonhuman primate monkeypox model: determination of the minimal effective dose and human dose justification	Therapeutics for the treatment of pathogenic orthopoxvirus infections are being sought. In the absence of patients with disease, animal models of orthopoxvirus disease are essential for evaluation of the efficacies of antiviral drugs and establishment of the appropriate dose and duration of human therapy. Infection of nonhuman primates (NHP) by the intravenous injection of monkeypox virus has been used to evaluate a promising therapeutic drug candidate, ST-246. ST-246 administered at 3 days postinfection (which corresponds to the secondary viremia stage of disease) at four different doses (from 100 mg/kg of body weight down to 3 mg/kg) once a day for 14 days was able to offer NHP 100% protection from a lethal infection with monkeypox virus and reduce the viral load and lesion formation. In NHP, the administration of ST-246 at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days resulted in levels of blood exposure comparable to the levels attained in humans administered 400 mg in the fed state. These results suggest that administration of an oral dosage of 400 mg once daily for 14 days will be effective for the prevention or treatment of smallpox or monkeypox infections in humans.	41	Randomized Controlled Trial	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.01596-08	Jordan R, Goff A, Frimm A, Corrado ML, Hensley LE, Byrd CM, Mucker E, Shamblin J, Bolken TC, Wlazlowski C, Johnson W, Chapman J, Twenhafel N, Tyavanagimatt S, Amantana A, Chinsangaram J, Hruby DE, Huggins J.

2844428	Clinico-epidemiological features of monkeypox patients with an animal or human source of infection	Clinical and laboratory examinations were carried out on a total of 338 monkeypox patients in Zaire from 1981 to 1986. An animal source of infection was suspected in 245 (72%) and interhuman transmission for the remaining 93 patients. Among those whose infection was presumably acquired from an animal source, the most affected groups were children aged 3-4 years (27%) and 5-6 years (20%), while only 4% of cases were over 15 years old; there was a considerable preponderance of males (58%) over females (42%), especially in the age group 5-14 years. Among those presumably infected by person-to-person transmission, the age distribution was more uniform, adult patients tending to be relatively more common, and there were more females (57%) than males (43%).Based on comparisons of the frequency and intensity of clinical signs and symptoms among patients infected from an animal source and those who were infected by another patient, there was no evidence that the disease becomes more severe and the transmitted virus more virulent or more easily transmissible from person to person after one or more passages through human hosts.	24	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Grab B, Szczeniowski M, Paluku KM, Mutombo M.

4340223	Human infection with monkeypox virus: laboratory investigation of six cases in West Africa	Between September 1970 and May 1971 six cases of human infection with monkeypox virus were identified in three West African countries-Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Four of the cases were confirmed by viral isolation, and two were diagnosed on epidemiological and serological evidence. Poxvirus strains isolated from the four cases were indistinguishable from reference monkeypox strains (Copenhagen and Utrecht), and all were easily differentiated from variola and vaccinia viruses. The isolated strains produced small necrotic haemorrhagic pocks on CAM, grew well at 39.0 degrees C, formed large plaques in Vero cell cultures, showed markedly more virulence for chick embryos and mice than do variola strains, and produced large necrotic haemorrhagic local lesions with generalized illness and florid secondary exanthem when inoculated into rabbit skin.The finding of smallpox-like illness in humans resulting from infection with a poxvirus of lower animal origin serves to emphasize the importance of thorough epidemiological and laboratory evaluation of all suspect smallpox cases occurring in areas where smallpox has been or is about to be eradicated.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Lourie B, Bingham PG, Evans HH, Foster SO, Nakano JH, Herrmann KL.

18165539	Prevalence of antibodies against orthopoxviruses among residents of Likouala region, Republic of Congo: evidence for monkeypox virus exposure	Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus (OPX) of west and central sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Likouala region, Republic of Congo to assess exposure to OPX. Whole blood was collected using Nobuto blood filter strips (NBFS). Titers of IgM and IgG to OPX were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared with serostatus using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors for independent association with serostatus. A total of 994 specimens were analyzed; the overall seroprevalence for OPX IgM was 1.7%. Age < 25 years reduced the likelihood of OPX exposure, and persons living in Ngangania village had independently higher odds (odds ratio = 33.5, 95% confidence interval = 7.2-166). Blood collection for serosurveys using NBFS is feasible and practical. Adult activities such as hunting and carcass preparation may play an important role in exposure to Monkeypox virus.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Lederman ER, Reynolds MG, Karem K, Braden Z, Learned-Orozco LA, Wassa-Wassa D, Moundeli O, Hughes C, Harvey J, Regnery R, Mombouli JV, Damon IK.

31062445	Varicella in Tshuapa Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, 2009-2014	Objective: To describe varicella cases in Tshuapa Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified during monkeypox surveillance. Methods: Demographic, clinical and epidemiological data were collected from each suspected monkeypox case 2009-2014. Samples were tested by PCR for both Orthopoxviruses and varicella-zoster virus (VZV); a subset of VZV-positive samples was genotyped. We defined a varicella case as a rash illness with laboratory-confirmed VZV. Results: There were 366 varicella cases were identified; 66% were ≤19 years old. Most patients had non-typical varicella rash with lesions reported as the same size and stage of evolution (86%), deep and profound (91%), on palms of hands and/or soles of feet (86%) and not itchy (49%). Many had non-typical signs and symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy (70%) and sensitivity to light (23%). A higher proportion of persons aged ≥20 years than persons aged ≤19 years had ≥50 lesions (79% vs. 65%, P = 0.007) and were bedridden (15% vs. 9%, P = 0.056). All VZV isolates genotyped from 79 varicella cases were clade 5. During the surveillance period, one possible VZV-related death occurred in a 7-year-old child. Conclusions: A large proportion of patients presented with non-typical varicella rash and clinical signs and symptoms, highlighting challenges identifying varicella in an area with endemic monkeypox. Continued surveillance and laboratory diagnosis will help in rapid identification and control of both monkeypox and varicella and improve our understanding of varicella epidemiology in Africa.	1	Information Unavailable	RDC; Africa; Afrique; Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC; République Démocratique du Congo; chickenpox; epidemiology; monkeypox; varicella; varicella-zoster virus; varicelle; variole du singe monkeypox; virus varicelle-zona; Épidémiologie	10.1111/tmi.13243	Leung J, McCollum AM, Radford K, Hughes C, Lopez AS, Guagliardo SAJ, Nguete B, Likafi T, Kabamba J, Malekani J, Shongo Lushima R, Pukuta E, Karhemere S, Muyembe Tamfum JJ, Reynolds MG, Wemakoy Okitolonda E, Schmid DS, Marin M.

18612436	Comparative analysis of viral gene expression programs during poxvirus infection: a transcriptional map of the vaccinia and monkeypox genomes	Background: Poxviruses engage in a complex and intricate dialogue with host cells as part of their strategy for replication. However, relatively little molecular detail is available with which to understand the mechanisms behind this dialogue. Methodology/principal findings: We designed a specialized microarray that contains probes specific to all predicted ORFs in the Monkeypox Zaire (MPXV) and Vaccinia Western Reserve (VACV) genomes, as well as >18,000 human genes, and used this tool to characterize MPXV and VACV gene expression responses in vitro during the course of primary infection of human monocytes, primary human fibroblasts and HeLa cells. The two viral transcriptomes show distinct features of temporal regulation and species-specific gene expression, and provide an early foundation for understanding global gene expression responses during poxvirus infection. Conclusions/significance: The results provide a temporal map of the transcriptome of each virus during infection, enabling us to compare viral gene expression across species, and classify expression patterns of previously uncharacterized ORFs.	33	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0002628	Rubins KH, Hensley LE, Bell GW, Wang C, Lefkowitz EJ, Brown PO, Relman DA.

20519404	Identification of wild-derived inbred mouse strains highly susceptible to monkeypox virus infection for use as small animal models	Infection with monkeypox virus (MPXV) causes disease manifestations in humans that are similar, although usually less severe, than those of smallpox. Since routine vaccination for smallpox ceased more than 30 years ago, there is concern that MPXV could be used for bioterrorism. Thus, there is a need to develop animal models to study MPXV infection. Accordingly, we screened 38 inbred mouse strains for susceptibility to MPXV. Three highly susceptible wild-derived inbred strains were identified, of which CAST/EiJ was further developed as a model. Using an intranasal route of infection with an isolate of the Congo Basin clade of MPXV, CAST/EiJ mice exhibited weight loss, morbidity, and death in a dose-dependent manner with a calculated 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of 680 PFU, whereas there were no deaths of BALB/c mice at a 10,000-fold higher dose. CAST/EiJ mice exhibited greater MPXV sensitivity when infected via the intraperitoneal route, with an LD(50) of 14 PFU. Both routes resulted in MPXV replication in the lung, spleen, and liver. Intranasal infection with an isolate of the less-pathogenic West African clade yielded an LD(50) of 7,600 PFU. The immune competence of CAST/EiJ mice was established by immunization with vaccinia virus, which induced antigen-specific T- and B-lymphocyte responses and fully protected mice from lethal doses of MPXV. The new mouse model has the following advantages for studying pathogenesis of MPXV, as well as for evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics: relative sensitivity to MPXV through multiple routes, genetic homogeneity, available immunological reagents, and commercial production.	36	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00621-10	Americo JL, Moss B, Earl PL.

21632764	Establishment of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) as a novel animal model for comparing smallpox vaccines administered preexposure in both high- and low-dose monkeypox virus challenges	The 2003 monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak and subsequent laboratory studies demonstrated that the black-tailed prairie dog is susceptible to MPXV infection and that the ensuing rash illness is similar to human systemic orthopoxvirus (OPXV) infection, including a 7- to 9-day incubation period and, likely, in some cases a respiratory route of infection; these features distinguish this model from others. The need for safe and efficacious vaccines for OPVX in areas where it is endemic or epidemic is important to protect an increasingly OPXV-naïve population. In this study, we tested current and investigational smallpox vaccines for safety, induction of anti-OPXV antibodies, and protection against mortality and morbidity in two MPXV challenges. None of the smallpox vaccines caused illness in this model, and all vaccinated animals showed anti-OPXV antibody responses and neutralizing antibody. We tested vaccine efficacy by challenging the animals with 10(5) or 10(6) PFU Congo Basin MPXV 30 days postvaccination and evaluating morbidity and mortality. Our results demonstrated that vaccination with either Dryvax or Acambis2000 protected the animals from death with no rash illness. Vaccination with IMVAMUNE also protected the animals from death, albeit with (modified) rash illness. Based on the results of this study, we believe prairie dogs offer a novel and potentially useful small animal model for the safety and efficacy testing of smallpox vaccines in pre- and postexposure vaccine testing, which is important for public health planning.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.02174-10	Keckler MS, Carroll DS, Gallardo-Romero NF, Lash RR, Salzer JS, Weiss SL, Patel N, Clemmons CJ, Smith SK, Hutson CL, Karem KL, Damon IK.

19141441	A prairie dog animal model of systemic orthopoxvirus disease using West African and Congo Basin strains of monkeypox virus	Multiple monkeypox virus (MPXV) animal models have been discussed in previous studies, but no small animal models, nor most non-human primate models, demonstrated the protracted asymptomatic incubation phase seen in systemic human orthopoxvirus illness. Herein, we characterize a black-tailed prairie dog (PD) (Cynomys ludovicianus) model of infection, via intranasal and intradermal exposures, with the two MPXV clades. Daily observations of the animals were made (food consumption, general symptoms, disease presentation), while weights and virus evaluations (ocular, nasal, oropharyngeal, faeces, blood) were obtained/made every third day. Generalized rash became apparent 9-12 days post-infection for all animals. Individual animals demonstrated a range of symptoms consistent with human monkeypox disease. Measurable viraemias and excretas were similar for both clade-representative strains and persisted until at least day 21. Greater morbidity was observed in Congo Basin strain-challenged animals and mortality was observed only in the Congo Basin strain-challenged animals. The PD model is valuable for the study of strain-dependent differences in MPXV. Additionally, the model closely mimics human systemic orthopoxvirus disease and may serve as a valuable non-human surrogate for investigations of antivirals and next generation orthopoxvirus vaccines.	44	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/vir.0.005108-0	Hutson CL, Olson VA, Carroll DS, Abel JA, Hughes CM, Braden ZH, Weiss S, Self J, Osorio JE, Hudson PN, Dillon M, Karem KL, Damon IK, Regnery RL.

15014500	Immunogenicity of a highly attenuated MVA smallpox vaccine and protection against monkeypox	The potential use of smallpox as a biological weapon has led to the production and stockpiling of smallpox vaccine and the immunization of some healthcare workers. Another public health goal is the licensing of a safer vaccine that could benefit the millions of people advised not to take the current one because they or their contacts have increased susceptibility to severe vaccine side effects. As vaccines can no longer be tested for their ability to prevent smallpox, licensing will necessarily include comparative immunogenicity and protection studies in non-human primates. Here we compare the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) with the licensed Dryvax vaccine in a monkey model. After two doses of MVA or one dose of MVA followed by Dryvax, antibody binding and neutralizing titres and T-cell responses were equivalent or higher than those induced by Dryvax alone. After challenge with monkeypox virus, unimmunized animals developed more than 500 pustular skin lesions and became gravely ill or died, whereas vaccinated animals were healthy and asymptomatic, except for a small number of transient skin lesions in animals immunized only with MVA.	156	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/nature02331	Earl PL, Americo JL, Wyatt LS, Eller LA, Whitbeck JC, Cohen GH, Eisenberg RJ, Hartmann CJ, Jackson DL, Kulesh DA, Martinez MJ, Miller DM, Mucker EM, Shamblin JD, Zwiers SH, Huggins JW, Jahrling PB, Moss B.

6330986	Nucleotide sequence of the thymidine kinase gene region of monkeypox and variola viruses	Among the orthopoxviruses variola virus induces in cells a characteristic thymidine kinase (TK) activity that can be feedback inhibited in reactions with thymidine triphosphate. Northern blot analyses of variola and monkeypox virus-infected cell extracts showed RNAs of the same molecular weight as the major (590-base) and minor (2380-base) TK transcripts described for vaccinia virus. The nucleotide sequences of 1275 bp in the TK gene region of variola and monkeypox viruses have been determined. When these sequences were compared with such sequences reported for vaccinia virus, differences were observed at 41 nucleotide positions. Examination of the putative encoded TK polypeptide for the three viruses revealed variation at eight amino acid positions. Two major differences in the amino acid composition of the variola virus TK were identified that might play a role in alteration of its kinetic properties.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0042-6822(84)90212-5	Esposito JJ, Knight JC.

3010703	Four generations of probable person-to-person transmission of human monkeypox	This paper examines an outbreak of five cases of human monkeypox which occurred in children belonging to two families living in the West Kasai region of Zaire during May-July 1983. Epidemiologic investigations suggest that the first case was infected from an animal source, possibly a monkey, and that each of the other four cases was infected from a previous human case. Three of these cases of presumed person-to-person transmission occurred in close household contacts. The other case infection occurred either by casual contact within the hospital compound, or possibly because of infection due to use of the same syringe for injections. Human monkeypox is the most important orthopoxvirus infection in the post-smallpox eradication period. The disease is a zoonosis and person-to-person transmission is rather difficult. Thus, this episode is a rare event and special analysis of the circumstances is discussed. However, it supports the necessity to carry out surveillance and research on this disease as recently reported by Arita et al.	26	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114328	Jezek Z, Arita I, Mutombo M, Dunn C, Nakano JH, Szczeniowski M.

22001879	Attenuated NYCBH vaccinia virus deleted for the E3L gene confers partial protection against lethal monkeypox virus disease in cynomolgus macaques	The New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) vaccinia virus is the currently licensed vaccine for use in the US against smallpox. The vaccine under investigation in this study has been attenuated by deletion of the innate immune evasion gene, E3L, and shown to be protective in homologous virus mouse challenge and heterologous virus mouse and rabbit challenge models. In this study we compared NYCBH deleted for the E3L gene (NYCBHΔE3L) to NYCBH for the ability to induce phosphorylation of proinflammatory signaling proteins and the ability to protect cynomolgus macaques from heterologous challenge with monkeypox virus (MPXV). NYCBHΔE3L induced phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α as well as p38, SAPK/JNK, and IRF3 which can lead to induction of proinflammatory gene transcription. Vaccination of macaques with two doses of NYCBHΔE3L resulted in negligible pock formation at the site of scarification in comparison to vaccination using a single dose of NYCBH, but still elicited neutralizing antibodies and protected 75% of the animals from mortality after challenge with MPXV. However, NYCBHΔE3L-vaccinated animals developed a high number of secondary skin lesions and blood viral load similar to that seen in unvaccinated controls. The NYCBHΔE3L-vaccinated animals that survived MPXV challenge were able to show resolution of blood viral load, a decrease in number of skin lesions, and an improved clinical score by three weeks post challenge. These results suggest that although the highly attenuated NYCBHΔE3L allows proinflammatory signal transduction to occur, it does not provide full protection against monkeypox challenge.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.09.135	Denzler KL, Babas T, Rippeon A, Huynh T, Fukushima N, Rhodes L, Silvera PM, Jacobs BL.

2176671	Nucleotide sequence comparison of homologous genomic regions from variola, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses	The nucleotide sequences of homologous regions from the genomes of variola major strain Harvey, variola minor strains Butler and Garcia, and monkeypox strain Denmark were determined. The nucleotide sequences were compared to the homologous region in vaccinia virus which contains part of one of the genes involved in determining host range. Two major differences were detected; these corresponded to a deletion in the promoter region and the presence of a premature stop codon. It was concluded that this region of the genome may not be actively expressed in either variola- or monkeypox-virus-infected cells. It was also concluded that diagnostic nucleic acid hybridisation probes for differentiating between these members of the Orthopoxviridae may be difficult to identify.	1	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.1890310405	Cowley R, Greenaway PJ.

25319753	Orthopoxvirus infection among wildlife in Zambia	Human monkeypox is a viral zoonosis caused by monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus (OPXV). The majority of human monkeypox cases have been reported in moist forested regions in West and Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In this study we investigated zoonotic OPXV infection among wild animals in Zambia, which shares a border with DRC, to assess the geographical distribution of OPXV. We screened for OPXV antibodies in sera from non-human primates (NHPs), rodents and shrews by ELISA, and performed real-time PCR to detect OPXV DNA in spleen samples. Serological analysis indicated that 38 of 259 (14.7 %) rodents, 14 of 42 (33.3 %) shrews and 4 of 188 (2.1 %) NHPs had antibodies against OPXV. The OPXV DNA could not be detected in spleens from any animals tested. Our results indicated that wild animals living in rural human habitation areas of Zambia have been infected with OPXV.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/vir.0.070219-0	Orba Y, Sasaki M, Yamaguchi H, Ishii A, Thomas Y, Ogawa H, Hang'ombe BM, Mweene AS, Morikawa S, Saijo M, Sawa H.

15557083	Extensive lesions of monkeypox in a prairie dog (Cynomys sp)	Monkeypox with extensive lesions was diagnosed in a prairie dog that was involved in a recent human outbreak of monkeypox in the Midwestern United States. Gross lesions included oral ulcers, pulmonary consolidation, enlarged cervical and thoracic lymph nodes, and multifocal, small, white umbilicated plaques in the gastrointestinal wall. Microscopic lesions were extensive in the lungs and consisted of fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia with vasculitis and poorly defined eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in cells thought to be alveolar epithelial cells, histiocytes, and fibroblasts. Multifocal necrotizing lesions, often accompanied by myxedema, were also present in most of the other examined organs. Aggregates of pox viral particles were observed within lesions by transmission electron microscopy. Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and virus culture at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This report highlights the difficulties of rapid diagnosis of exotic or emerging diseases and further substantiates the prairie dog as an animal model of monkeypox.	11	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1354/vp.41-6-702	Langohr IM, Stevenson GW, Thacker HL, Regnery RL.

11742030	The pathology of experimental aerosolized monkeypox virus infection in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis)	Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed by fine-particle aerosol to lethal doses of monkeypox virus, Zaire strain. Death, attributable to fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia, occurred 9 to 17 days postexposure. Lower airway epithelium served as the principal target for primary infection. The relative degree of involvement among lymphoid tissues suggested that tonsil, mediastinal, and mandibular lymph nodes were also infected early in the course of the disease, and may have served as additional, although subordinate, sites of primary replication. The distribution of lesions was consistent with lymphatogenous spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes and systemic dissemination of the virus through a monocytic cell-associated viremia. This resulted in lesions affecting other lymph nodes, the thymus, spleen, skin, oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system. The mononuclear phagocyte/dendritic cell system was the principal target within lymphoid tissues and may also have provided the means of entry into other systemic sites. Hepatic involvement was uncommon. Lesions at all affected sites were characterized morphologically as necrotizing. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of select lesions suggested that cell death within lymphoid and epithelial tissues was due in large part to apoptosis. Skin and mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts also exhibited variable proliferation of epithelial cells and subjacent fibroblasts. Epithelial intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, consistent with Guarnieri bodies, were usually inconspicuous by light microscopy, but when present, were most readily apparent in the stratified squamous epithelium of the oral mucosa and epidermis. Multinucleated syncytial cells were also occasionally observed in the stratified squamous epithelium of the tongue, tonsil, and skin, and in the intestinal mucosa. Monkeypox virus antigen was readily demonstrated by immunohistochemistry using anti-vaccinia mouse polyclonal antibodies as well as anti-monkeypox rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Detectable poxviral antigen was limited to sites exhibiting obvious morphologic involvement and was most prominent within epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts of affected tissues. The presence of poxviral antigen, as determined by immunohistochemistry, correlated with ultrastructural identification of replicating virus. Concurrent bacterial septicemia, present in one monkey, was associated with increased dissemination of the virus to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and resulted in a more rapidly fatal clinical course.	72	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/labinvest.3780373	Zaucha GM, Jahrling PB, Geisbert TW, Swearengen JR, Hensley L.

15617321	[Monkey-pox, a model of emergent then reemergent disease]	"The recent emergence of monkey pox in the United States of America highlights the problem (known for other infectious agents) of dissemination of pathogens outside their endemic area, and of subsequent global threats of variable gravity according to agents. It is a real emergency since monkey pox had been confined to Africa for several decades, where small epidemics occurred from time to time, monkey pox is a ""miniature smallpox"" which, in Africa, evolves on an endemic (zoonotic) mode with, as reservoirs, several species of wild rodents (mainly squirrels) and some monkey species. It can be accidentally transmitted to man then develops as epidemics, sometimes leading to death. The virus was imported in 2003 in the United States of America, via Gambia rats and wild squirrels (all African species), and infected prairie dogs (which are now in fashion as pets), then crossed the species barrier to man. In the United States of America, screening campaigns, epidemiological investigations, and subsequent treatments led to a rapid control of the epidemic, which is a model of emergent disease for this country. Therapeutic and preventive measures directly applicable to monkey pox are discussed. They can also be applied against other pox virus infections (including smallpox). The risk of criminal introduction of pox viruses is discussed since it is, more than ever, a real worldwide threat."

16893833	Recent animal disease outbreaks and their impact on human populations	Over the past 20 years, headlines have documented an increasing number of emerging diseases; most have an animal source (zoonoses). Recent examples include West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, and monkeypox. While some emerging diseases occur among both humans and animals, others affect only animals or only humans. Nevertheless, all these new or reemerging infections have societal implications, often tied to local and national economies. It is important to understand the implications of emerging animal diseases and encourage stronger collaboration of veterinary and medical practitioners, especially in rural areas. Illnesses in agricultural workers may be the index cases for newly emerging diseases.	3	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1300/J096v11n01_02	Bender JB, Hueston W, Osterholm M.

4340219	Isolation and properties of the causal agent of a new variola-like disease (monkeypox) in man	The causal agent of a case of disease in man occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a similar clinical picture to smallpox was isolated and studied. The agent was identified as monkeypox virus. A comparative study of the isolated strain (Congo-8) and of viruses isolated from similar cases of illness in Liberia (Liberia-1 and Liberia-2 strains) and Sierra Leone (V-70 1 266 strain) showed that they were identical. A number of local species of monkeys and apes were examined serologically in the Congo region to determine the probability of human infection with monkeypox virus. It was confirmed that the animals had had contact with an agent of the poxvirus group. In 2 of the 7 sera examined, antibodies of the variola-vaccinia group of poxviruses were discovered (virus-neutralizing antibodies, precipitins, and antihaemagglutinins). In a chimpanzee, antihaemagglutinins were found in a titre of 1: 1 280, and in the same animal a variola-like virus was isolated from the kidneys. In the course of the investigation, it was shown conclusively that monkeypox virus and the strains under investigation could be distinguished from o dinary variola and vaccinia viruses on the basis of their behaviour in pig embryo kidney continuous cell line culture.	18	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Marennikova SS, Seluhina EM, Mal'ceva NN, Cimiskjan KL, Macevic GR.

20728526	Smallpox vaccine with integrated IL-15 demonstrates enhanced in vivo viral clearance in immunodeficient mice and confers long term protection against a lethal monkeypox challenge in cynomolgus monkeys	Despite the eradication of smallpox, there is heightened concern that it could be reintroduced as a result of intentional release of Variola major virus through an act of bioterrorism. The live vaccine that was pivotal in the eradication of smallpox though considered a gold standard for its efficacy still retains sufficient residual virulence that can cause life-threatening sequelae especially in immune deficient individuals. Therefore, a safer smallpox vaccine that can match the efficacy of first generation vaccines is urgently needed. We previously reported that the integration of human IL-15 cytokine into the genome of Wyeth strain of vaccinia (Wyeth/IL-15), the same strain as the licensed vaccine, generates a vaccine with superior immunogenicity and efficacy in a mouse model. We now demonstrate that Wyeth/IL-15 is non-lethal to athymic nude mice when administered intravenously at a dose of 10(7) plaque forming units and it undergoes enhanced in vivo clearance in these immune deficient mice. Furthermore, a majority of cynomolgus monkeys vaccinated with vaccinia viruses with integrated IL-15, when challenged 3 years later with a lethal dose of monkeypox virus displayed milder clinical manifestations with complete recovery supporting the utility of Wyeth/IL-15 for contemporary populations as a safer and efficacious smallpox vaccine.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.08.008	Zielinski RJ, Smedley JV, Perera PY, Silvera PM, Waldmann TA, Capala J, Perera LP.

11959564	Characterization of wild-type and cidofovir-resistant strains of camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses	Cidofovir ([(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine] [HPMPC])-resistant forms of camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses were developed by prolonged passage in Vero 76 cells in the presence of drug. Eight- to 27-fold-higher concentrations of cidofovir were required to inhibit the resistant viruses than were needed to inhibit the wild-type (WT) viruses. Resistant viruses were characterized by determining their cross-resistance to other antiviral compounds, examining their different replication abilities in two cell lines, studying the biochemical basis of their drug resistance, and assessing the degrees of their virulence in mice. These viruses were cross resistant to cyclic HPMPC and, with the exception of vaccinia virus, to (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine. Three of the four resistant cowpox and monkeypox viruses exhibited reduced abilities to infect and replicate in 3T3 cells compared to their abilities in Vero 76 cells. Compared to the WT virus polymers the resistant cowpox virus DNA polymerase was 8.5-fold less sensitive to inhibition by cidofovir diphosphate, the active form of the drug. Intracellular phosphorylation of [3H]cidofovir was not stimulated or inhibited by infection with resistant cowpox virus. In intranasally infected BALB/c mice, WT cowpox virus was 80-fold more virulent than the resistant virus. Cidofovir treatment (100 mg/kg of body weight, given one time only as early as 5 min after virus challenge) of a resistant cowpox virus infection could not protect mice from mortality. However, the drug prevented mortality in 80 to 100% of the mice treated with a single 100-mg/kg dose at 1, 2, 3, or 4 days after WT virus challenge. By application of these results to human orthopoxvirus infections, it is anticipated that resistant viruses may be untreatable with cidofovir but their virulence may be attenuated. Studies will need to be conducted with cidofovir-resistant monkeypox virus in monkeys to further support these hypotheses.	38	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.46.5.1329-1335.2002	Smee DF, Sidwell RW, Kefauver D, Bray M, Huggins JW.

28763036	Evaluation of Taterapox Virus in Small Animals	Taterapox virus (TATV), which was isolated from an African gerbil (Tatera kempi) in 1975, is the most closely related virus to variola; however, only the original report has examined its virology. We have evaluated the tropism of TATV in vivo in small animals. We found that TATV does not infect Graphiurus kelleni, a species of African dormouse, but does induce seroconversion in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) and in mice; however, in wild-type mice and gerbils, the virus produces an unapparent infection. Following intranasal and footpad inoculations with 1 × 10⁶ plaque forming units (PFU) of TATV, immunocompromised stat1-/- mice showed signs of disease but did not die; however, SCID mice were susceptible to intranasal and footpad infections with 100% mortality observed by Day 35 and Day 54, respectively. We show that death is unlikely to be a result of the virus mutating to have increased virulence and that SCID mice are capable of transmitting TATV to C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 stat1-/- animals; however, transmission did not occur from TATV inoculated wild-type or stat1-/- mice. Comparisons with ectromelia (the etiological agent of mousepox) suggest that TATV behaves differently both at the site of inoculation and in the immune response that it triggers.	3	Information Unavailable	SCID; footpad; intranasal; monkeypox; orthopoxvirus; smallpox; taterapox; variola	10.3390/v9080203	Parker S, Crump R, Hartzler H, Buller RM.

32629851	Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) Complex Proteins Facilitate Orthopoxvirus Entry, Fusion and Spread	Although orthopoxviruses (OPXV) are known to encode a majority of the genes required for replication in host cells, genome-wide genetic screens have revealed that several host pathways are indispensable for OPXV infection. Through a haploid genetic screen, we previously identified several host genes required for monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection, including the individual genes that form the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. The COG complex is an eight-protein (COG1-COG8) vesicle tethering complex important for regulating membrane trafficking, glycosylation enzymes, and maintaining Golgi structure. In this study, we investigated the role of the COG complex in OPXV infection using cell lines with individual COG gene knockout (KO) mutations. COG KO cells infected with MPXV and vaccinia virus (VACV) produced small plaques and a lower virus yield compared to wild type (WT) cells. In cells where the KO phenotype was reversed using a rescue plasmid, the size of virus plaques increased demonstrating a direct link between the decrease in viral spread and the KO of COG genes. KO cells infected with VACV displayed lower levels of viral fusion and entry compared to WT suggesting that the COG complex is important for early events in OPXV infection. Additionally, fewer actin tails were observed in VACV-infected KO cells compared to WT. Since COG complex proteins are required for cellular trafficking of glycosylated membrane proteins, the disruption of this process due to lack of individual COG complex proteins may potentially impair the virus-cell interactions required for viral entry and egress. These data validate that the COG complex previously identified in our genetic screens plays a role in OPXV infection.	3	Information Unavailable	COG complex; glycosylation; monkeypox; vaccinia; viral attachment; viral entry	10.3390/v12070707	Realegeno S, Priyamvada L, Kumar A, Blackburn JB, Hartloge C, Puschnik AS, Sambhara S, Olson VA, Carette JE, Lupashin V, Satheshkumar PS.

2988159	The histopathology and electron microscopy of a human monkeypox lesion	The histological and electron microscopic findings from a solitary cutaneous monkeypox lesion taken post mortem from a child who died after a five-day illness are reported. This child is 44th in the WHO register of monkeypox cases. The lesion was at the papulonecrotic stage, with early evidence of vesiculation and minimal evidence of pustulation. Necrosis affected the stratum basale, the related basement membrane and adjacent areas of the dermal papillae at the centre of the lesion. Cell necrosis affected the next two or three layers of stratum spinosum above the destroyed stratum basale. Lateral to this zone, marked hyperplasia and intracellular oedema of the stratum spinosum constituted the papule and produced spindle-cell features. In the middle layer of the stratum spinosum, above the necrotic focus, there were minute vesicles and between these were occasional multinuclear giant cells. Bodies similar to Guarnieri bodies (GB) were present in the cytoplasm of sweat duct-lining cells in the epidermis and upper corium. Very scanty similar bodies were evident elsewhere in the papular epidermis but were difficult to distinguish from debris. Granules in the lesion with the same size as mature virions (elementary bodies) have been assessed not to be these because similar granules are present in the normal epidermis. Changes in the dermis apart from those mentioned above were minimal oedema, very mild perivascular infiltration by round cells and an occasional eosinophil. Electron microscopy showed abundant immature and mature orthopoxvirus particles in the cytoplasms of infected epidermal cells. A limited range of histochemical tests is detailed. In general, the features are indistinguishable from the papulonecrotic stage of smallpox (variola) and from tanapox as recorded in man.	6	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0035-9203(85)90333-5	Stagles MJ, Watson AA, Boyd JF, More IA, McSeveney D.

21369346	Efficacy of CMX001 as a prophylactic and presymptomatic antiviral agent in New Zealand white rabbits infected with rabbitpox virus, a model for orthopoxvirus infections of humans	CMX001, a lipophilic nucleotide analog formed by covalently linking 3-(hexdecyloxy)propan-1-ol to cidofovir (CDV), is being developed as a treatment for smallpox. CMX001 has dramatically increased potency versus CDV against all dsDNA viruses and, in contrast to CDV, is orally available and has shown no evidence of nephrotoxicity in healthy volunteers or severely ill transplant patients to date. Although smallpox has been eliminated from the environment, treatments are urgently being sought due to the risk of smallpox being used as a bioterrorism agent and for monkeypox virus, a zoonotic disease of Africa, and adverse reactions to smallpox virus vaccinations. In the absence of human cases of smallpox, new treatments must be tested for efficacy in animal models. Here we first review and discuss the rabbitpox virus (RPV) infection of New Zealand White rabbits as a model for smallpox to test the efficacy of CMX001 as a prophylactic and early disease antiviral. Our results should also be applicable to monkeypox virus infections and for treatment of adverse reactions to smallpox vaccination.	15	Review	CMX001; antiviral; poxvirus; rabbitpox; smallpox treatment	10.3390/v3020063	Rice AD, Adams MM, Lampert B, Foster S, Robertson A, Painter G, Moyer RW.

12368068	Cidofovir in the therapy and short-term prophylaxis of poxvirus infections	Although it is often stated that only vaccination would be able to contain or protect the population against a catastrophic smallpox outbreak, the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analog cidofovir offers a valuable alternative for the therapy and short-term pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, not only of smallpox but also of other poxvirus infections and DNA viruses. Cidofovir has proven effective against vaccinia, cowpox and monkeypox in various animal model infections. In cell culture, cidofovir has demonstrated activity against variola virus, the etiological agent of smallpox, and in patients it has shown marked efficacy against molluscum contagiosum and orf, two poxvirus infections. Cidofovir is available as an aqueous solution for intravenous administration and could be reformulated for topical (cream or gel), intranasal (aerosol) or peroral (as a lipid prodrug) use, should the need arise.	14	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0165-6147(02)02091-6	De Clercq E.

2450423	Epitope mosaic on the surface proteins of orthopoxviruses	Epitopes on the surface components of orthopoxviruses were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against monkeypox and vaccinia viruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting (WB), radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP), and competitive binding inhibition assay (CBIA). When compared by ELISA, three vaccinia virus strains exhibited a similar reactivity to 99 tested MAbs despite their remote passage history. All five isolates of monkeypox virus closely resembled one another, irrespective of the host species (human, monkey, squirrel) from which they were isolated. Taterapox virus reacted similar to vaccinia virus against 97 of the 99 tested MAbs, and reacted with 2 MAbs which were cross-reactive with monkeypox and mousepox. Mousepox and cowpox viruses reacted with these MAbs in a species-specific manner: MAbs reactive to cowpox virus distinctly differ from those reactive to mousepox virus. Of the 99 tested MAbs, 32 reacted with all the 11 tested orthopoxviruses, indicating that the corresponding epitopes existed in all the viruses. Fifty-four MAbs reacted with two or more virus species and were classified as partially common MAbs. Eight MAbs were apparently type-specific for monkeypox, and five were specific for vaccinia and taterapox viruses. No strain-specific epitope was detected. Sera of monkeypox-infected patients, when analyzed by CBIA, interfered with the binding of monkeypox-specific MAb H12C1 but not of vaccinia-specific MAb G6C6. Sera of monkeypox-infected patients who had been vaccinated competed against both MAbs, demonstrating the original antigenic sin phenomenon. The two MAbs could distinguish between the sera of monkeypox patients and those of vaccinated persons. However, the serum of a smallpox patient was competitive against these apparently vaccinia- or monkeypox-specific MAbs. Three of the eight monkeypox-specific epitopes were recognized by the above CBIA test, which suggests that they also exist in smallpox virus. The mosaic-like combination of common epitopes and the small number of type-specific epitopes manifested the antigenic characteristics of orthopox viruses. The species boundary was obscured due to the partially common epitopes, but the total composition of epitopes was stable enough to maintain the antigenic species-specificity. The mutual relationship of the orthopoxviruses was visualized in a three-dimensional network.	6	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0042-6822(88)90240-1	Ichihashi Y, Oie M.

21373379	Efficacy of CMX001 as a post exposure antiviral in New Zealand White rabbits infected with rabbitpox virus, a model for orthopoxvirus infections of humans	CMX001, a lipophilic nucleotide analog formed by covalently linking 3-(hexdecyloxy)propan-1-ol to cidofovir (CDV), is being developed as a treatment for smallpox. In the absence of human cases of smallpox, new treatments must be tested for efficacy in animal models. Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of CMX001 in protecting New Zealand White rabbits from mortality following intradermal infection with rabbitpox virus as a model for smallpox, monkeypox and for treatment of adverse reactions to smallpox vaccination. Here we extend these studies by exploring different dosing regimens and performing randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled studies. In addition, because rabbitpox virus can be transmitted via naturally generated aerosols (animal to animal transmission), we report on studies to test the efficacy of CMX001 in protecting rabbits from lethal rabbitpox virus disease when infection occurs by animal to animal transmission. In all cases, CMX001 treatment was initiated at the onset of observable lesions in the ears to model the use of CMX001 as a treatment for symptomatic smallpox. The results demonstrate that CMX001 is an effective treatment for symptomatic rabbitpox virus infection. The rabbitpox model has key similarities to human smallpox including an incubation period, generalized systemic disease, the occurrence of lesions which may be used as a trigger for initiating therapy, and natural animal to animal spread, making it an appropriate model.	18	Review	CMX001; antiviral; poxvirus; rabbitpox; smallpox treatment	10.3390/v3010047	Rice AD, Adams MM, Wallace G, Burrage AM, Lindsey SF, Smith AJ, Swetnam D, Manning BR, Gray SA, Lampert B, Foster S, Lanier R, Robertson A, Painter G, Moyer RW.

23251431	Effects of epidemic diseases on the distribution of bonobos	This study examined how outbreaks and the occurrence of Anthrax, Ebola, Monkeypox and Trypanosomiasis may differentially affect the distribution of bonobos (Pan paniscus). Using a combination of mapping, Jaccard overlapping coefficients and binary regressions, the study determined how each disease correlated with the extent of occurrence of, and the areas occupied by, bonobos. Anthrax has only been reported to occur outside the range of bonobos and so was not considered further. Ebola, Monkeypox and Trypanosomiasis were each reported within the area of occupancy of bonobos. Their respective overlap coefficients were: J = 0.10; Q(α = 0.05) = 2.00 (odds ratios = 0.0001, 95% CI = 0.0057; Z = -19.41, significant) for Ebola; J = 1.00; Q(α = 0.05) = 24.0 (odds ratios = 1.504, 95% CI = 0.5066-2.6122) for Monkeypox; and, J = 0.33; Q(α = 0.05) = 11.5 (Z = 1.14, significant) for Trypanosomiasis. There were significant relationships for the presence and absence of Monkeypox and Trypanosomiasis and the known extent of occurrence of bonobos, based on the equations y = 0.2368Ln(x)+0.8006 (R(2) = 0.9772) and y = -0.2942Ln(x)+0.7155 (R(2) = 0.698), respectively. The positive relationship suggested that bonobos tolerated the presence of Monkeypox. In contrast, the significant negative coefficient suggested that bonobos were absent in areas where Trypanosomiasis is endemic. Our results suggest that large rivers may have prevented Ebola from spreading into the range of bonobos. Meanwhile, Trypanosomiasis has been recorded among humans within the area of occurrence of bonobos, and appears the most important disease in shaping the area of occupancy of bonobos within their overall extent of occupancy.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0051112	Inogwabini BI, Leader-Williams N.

26861777	New effective chemically synthesized anti-smallpox compound NIOCH-14	Antiviral activity of the new chemically synthesized compound NIOCH-14 (a derivative of tricyclodicarboxylic acid) in comparison with ST-246 (the condensed derivative of pyrroledione) was observed in experiments in vitro and in vivo using orthopoxviruses including highly pathogenic ones. After oral administration of NIOCH-14 to outbred ICR mice infected intranasally with 100 % lethal dose of ectromelia virus, it was shown that 50 % effective doses of NIOCH-14 and ST-246 did not significantly differ. The 'therapeutic window' varied from 1 day before infection to 6 days post-infection (p.i.) to achieve 100-60 % survival rate. The administration of NIOCH-14 and ST-246 to mice resulted in a significant reduction of ectromelia virus titres in organs examined as compared with the control and also reduced pathological changes in the lungs 6 days p.i. Oral administration of NIOCH-14 and ST-246 to ICR mice and marmots challenged with monkeypox virus as compared with the control resulted in a significant reduction of virus production in the lungs and the proportion of infected mice 7 days p.i. as well as the absence of disease in marmots. Significantly lower proportions of infected mice and virus production levels in the lungs as compared with the control were demonstrated in experiments after oral administration of NIOCH-14 and ST-246 to ICR mice and immunodeficient SCID mice challenged with variola virus 3 and 4 days p.i., respectively. The results obtained suggest good prospects for further study of the chemical compound NIOCH-14 to create a new smallpox drug on its basis.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/jgv.0.000422	Mazurkov OY, Kabanov AS, Shishkina LN, Sergeev AA, Skarnovich MO, Bormotov NI, Skarnovich MA, Ovchinnikova AS, Titova KA, Galahova DO, Bulychev LE, Sergeev AA, Taranov OS, Selivanov BA, Tikhonov AY, Zavjalov EL, Agafonov AP, Sergeev AN.

27768891	Cross-Neutralizing and Protective Human Antibody Specificities to Poxvirus Infections	Monkeypox (MPXV) and cowpox (CPXV) are emerging agents that cause severe human infections on an intermittent basis, and variola virus (VARV) has potential for use as an agent of bioterror. Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) has been used therapeutically to treat severe orthopoxvirus infections but is in short supply. We generated a large panel of orthopoxvirus-specific human monoclonal antibodies (Abs) from immune subjects to investigate the molecular basis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses for diverse orthopoxviruses. Detailed analysis revealed the principal neutralizing antibody specificities that are cross-reactive for VACV, CPXV, MPXV, and VARV and that are determinants of protection in murine challenge models. Optimal protection following respiratory or systemic infection required a mixture of Abs that targeted several membrane proteins, including proteins on enveloped and mature virion forms of virus. This work reveals orthopoxvirus targets for human Abs that mediate cross-protective immunity and identifies new candidate Ab therapeutic mixtures to replace VIG.	24	Information Unavailable	antigen specificity; cross-neutralization; human monoclonal antibodies; poxvirus infections; protective immunity; smallpox vaccine	10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.049	Gilchuk I, Gilchuk P, Sapparapu G, Lampley R, Singh V, Kose N, Blum DL, Hughes LJ, Satheshkumar PS, Townsend MB, Kondas AV, Reed Z, Weiner Z, Olson VA, Hammarlund E, Raue HP, Slifka MK, Slaughter JC, Graham BS, Edwards KM, Eisenberg RJ, Cohen GH, Joyce S, Crowe JE Jr.	Cell. 2016 Oct 20;167(3):684-694.e9. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.049.

28131867	A rapid Orthopoxvirus purification protocol suitable for high-containment laboratories	Virus purification in a high-containment setting provides unique challenges due to barrier precautions and operational safety approaches that are not necessary in lower biosafety level (BSL) 2 environments. The need for high risk group pathogen diagnostic assay development, anti-viral research, pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy research necessitates work in BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs with infectious agents. When this work is performed in accordance with BSL-4 practices, modifications are often required in standard protocols. Classical virus purification techniques are difficult to execute in a BSL-3 or BSL-4 laboratory because of the work practices used in these environments. Orthopoxviruses are a family of viruses that, in some cases, requires work in a high-containment laboratory and due to size do not lend themselves to simpler purification methods. Current CDC purification techniques of orthopoxviruses uses 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane, commonly known as Genetron®. Genetron® is a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) that has been shown to be detrimental to the ozone and has been phased out and the limited amount of product makes it no longer a feasible option for poxvirus purification purposes. Here we demonstrate a new Orthopoxvirus purification method that is suitable for high-containment laboratories and produces virus that is not only comparable to previous purification methods, but improves on purity and yield.	2	Information Unavailable	High-containment; Monkeypox; Orthopoxvirus; Purification; Variola	10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.01.018	Hughes L, Wilkins K, Goldsmith CS, Smith S, Hudson P, Patel N, Karem K, Damon I, Li Y, Olson VA, Satheshkumar PS.

6243923	Virion polypeptides of poxviruses	Structural polypeptides from a number of poxviruses were analysed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The patterns obtained with orthopoxviruses were generally quite similar to one another, but variola, monkeypox, cowpox and vaccinia viruses could be distinquished by their profiles in the molecular weight (mol. wt.) region around 30,000 to 40,000; some additional variation was found amongst cowpox and vaccinia strains. Whitepox virus was shown to have structural polypeptides indistinguishable from those of variola virus. The structural polypeptides of poxviruses belonging to other genera were different from those of the orthopoxvirus, except those of mol. wt. about 122,000 and 97,000, which were common to all viruses irrespective of genus. A polypeptide of mol. wt. about 25,000 was also observed in all cases, though its position varied slightly with the individual virus.	4	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1007/BF01315028	Arita M, Tagaya I.

179217	[Generalized monkeypox in orally infected rabbits and white mice]	In the past 5 years 17 human cases of monkeypox with 4 deaths were reported in African countries. The source and the mechanism of transmission of the infection are unknown. One of the possible modes of human infection could be through monkey meat used for food. The paper presents the results of the study of susceptibility of 4 species of laboratory animals to monkeypox virus given orally. Adult rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters were found to be resistant. Ten-day-old rabbits and 8-, 10- and 12-day-old mice developed generalized infection with eruptions and high lethality. The infection was transmitted to uninfected rabbits of the same litter, apparently by air-borne droplet mode. The obtained model of generalized monkeypox infection after per os administration of the virus and the fact of air-borne droplet transmission of infection may serve as indirect evidence of the possibility of transmission of the infection by this mode in nature.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Shchelukhina EM, Marennikova SS.

23994378	The effects of post-exposure smallpox vaccination on clinical disease presentation: addressing the data gaps between historical epidemiology and modern surrogate model data	Decades after public health interventions - including pre- and post-exposure vaccination - were used to eradicate smallpox, zoonotic orthopoxvirus outbreaks and the potential threat of a release of variola virus remain public health concerns. Routine prophylactic smallpox vaccination of the public ceased worldwide in 1980, and the adverse event rate associated with the currently licensed live vaccinia virus vaccine makes reinstatement of policies recommending routine pre-exposure vaccination unlikely in the absence of an orthopoxvirus outbreak. Consequently, licensing of safer vaccines and therapeutics that can be used post-orthopoxvirus exposure is necessary to protect the global population from these threats. Variola virus is a solely human pathogen that does not naturally infect any other known animal species. Therefore, the use of surrogate viruses in animal models of orthopoxvirus infection is important for the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Major complications involved with the use of surrogate models include both the absence of a model that accurately mimics all aspects of human smallpox disease and a lack of reproducibility across model species. These complications limit our ability to model post-exposure vaccination with newer vaccines for application to human orthopoxvirus outbreaks. This review seeks to (1) summarize conclusions about the efficacy of post-exposure smallpox vaccination from historic epidemiological reports and modern animal studies; (2) identify data gaps in these studies; and (3) summarize the clinical features of orthopoxvirus-associated infections in various animal models to identify those models that are most useful for post-exposure vaccination studies. The ultimate purpose of this review is to provide observations and comments regarding available model systems and data gaps for use in improving post-exposure medical countermeasures against orthopoxviruses.	12	Review	Animal models; Epidemiology; Monkeypox; Orthopoxviruses; Post-exposure vaccination; Prophylactic vaccination; Smallpox; Smallpox vaccination; Vaccinia; Variola virus	10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.08.039	Keckler MS, Reynolds MG, Damon IK, Karem KL.

15349775	Bioterrorism: is it a real threat?	The Geneva Protocol of 1925 commits the signatory nations to refraining from the use of biological weapons. However, the terrorist assaults of September 2001 and, subsequently, the anthrax-containing letters are cause for great concerns: new threats to the security of nations are expected, as terrorist organizations seem to increasingly explore novel ways of spreading terror. In this context, naturally emerging diseases such as SARS, monkeypox or West Nile fever assume new importance because it is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults. Great efforts on the part of governments and public health authorities are necessary to counteract these threats.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1007/s00430-004-0228-z	Gottschalk R, Preiser W.

27938377	Rapid and sensitive point-of-care detection of Orthopoxviruses by ABICAP immunofiltration	Background: The rapid and reliable detection of infectious agents is one of the most challenging tasks in scenarios lacking well-equipped laboratory infrastructure, like diagnostics in rural areas of developing countries. Commercially available point-of-care diagnostic tests for emerging and rare diseases are particularly scarce. Results: In this work we present a point-of-care test for the detection of Orthopoxviruses (OPV). The OPV ABICAP assay detects down to 1 × 104 plaque forming units/mL of OPV particles within 45 min. It can be applied to clinical material like skin crusts and detects all zoonotic OPV infecting humans, including Vaccinia, Cowpox, Monkeypox, and most importantly Variola virus. Conclusions: Given the high sensitivity and the ease of handling, the novel assay could be highly useful for on-site diagnostics of suspected Monkeypox virus infections in areas lacking proper laboratory infrastructure as well as rapid on-site testing of suspected bioterrorism samples.	3	Information Unavailable	ABICAP; Cowpox virus; Monkeypox virus; Orthopoxvirus; Point-of-care; Rapid detection; Vaccinia virus; Variola virus; Zoonosis; bioterrorism	10.1186/s12985-016-0665-5	Stern D, Olson VA, Smith SK, Pietraszczyk M, Miller L, Miethe P, Dorner BG, Nitsche A.

Basic studies of biodiversity, functional properties of viral DNA and proteins, pathogenesis, and evolution are required. Live smallpox virus should be used at certain and particularly final stages for these studies that are of scientific and applied significance.	1	Review	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	L'vov DK, Zverev VV, Gintsburg AL, Marennikova SS, Pal'tsev MA.

22999097	Orthopoxvirus species and strain differences in cell entry	"Vaccinia virus (VACV) enters cells by a low pH endosomal route or by direct fusion with the plasma membrane. We previously found differences in entry properties of several VACV strains: entry of WR was enhanced by low pH, reduced by bafilomycin A1 and relatively unaffected by heparin, whereas entry of IHD-J, Copenhagen and Elstree were oppositely affected. Since binding and entry modes may have been selected by specific conditions of in vitro propagation, we now examined the properties of three distinct, recently isolated cowpox viruses and a monkeypox virus as well as additional VACV and cowpox virus strains. The recent isolates were more similar to WR than to other VACV strains, underscoring the biological importance of endosomal entry by orthopoxviruses. Sequence comparisons, gene deletions and gene swapping experiments indicated that viral determinants, other than or in addition to the A26 and A25 ""fusion-suppressor"" proteins, impact entry properties."	19	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2012.08.044	Bengali Z, Satheshkumar PS, Moss B.

3037740	Monkeypox virus in relation to the ecological features surrounding human settlements in Bumba zone, Zaire	Since monkeypox virus was discovered in animals in 1958 and in man in 1971, several efforts have been made to identify the reservoir of the virus in nature. In July 1985 a study on human environments and animals suspected to maintain virus transmission was carried out in northern Zaire. The study revealed three well demarcated areas: the human settlement area, the agricultural area and the primary tropical rain forest. The first two were found inhabited by terrestrial and arboreal rodents and bats, while the larger animals have abandoned them. Data on human morbidity collected in the preceding years suggested that most of the patients were infected either in the settlement or in the agricultural area. Isolation of the virus from a squirrel confirmed this suggestion and proved, on the other hand, that the virus could circulate in an area deprived of the larger wild animals, including primates. The virus isolation and results of serologic testing suggest that out of three groups of animals inhabiting the agricultural area, the squirrels Funisciurus anerythrus should be considered a priority candidate to sustain virus transmission.	24	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Khodakevich L, Szczeniowski M, Nambu-ma-Disu, Jezek Z, Marennikova S, Nakano J, Meier F.

21994641	Cidofovir Activity against Poxvirus Infections	Cidofovir [(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine, HPMPC] is an acyclic nucleoside analog approved since 1996 for clinical use in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. Cidofovir (CDV) has broad-spectrum activity against DNA viruses, including herpes-, adeno-, polyoma-, papilloma- and poxviruses. Among poxviruses, cidofovir has shown in vitro activity against orthopox [vaccinia, variola (smallpox), cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, ectromelia], molluscipox [molluscum contagiosum] and parapox [orf] viruses. The anti-poxvirus activity of cidofovir in vivo has been shown in different models of infection when the compound was administered either intraperitoneal, intranasal (aerosolized) or topically. In humans, cidofovir has been successfully used for the treatment of recalcitrant molluscum contagiosum virus and orf virus in immunocompromised patients. CDV remains a reference compound against poxviruses and holds potential for the therapy and short-term prophylaxis of not only orthopox- but also parapox- and molluscipoxvirus infections.	13	Information Unavailable	acyclic nucleoside analog; cidofovir; poxviruses	10.3390/v2122803	Andrei G, Snoeck R.

21485495	[Evasion of mammalian organism defense systems by orthopoxviruses]	Viruses during their evolution have mastered various molecular mechanisms to evade the defense reactions of the host organism. When understanding the mechanisms used by viruses to overcome manifold defense systems of the animal organism, represented by molecular factors and cells of the immune system, we would not only comprehend better, but also discover new patterns of organization and function of these most important reactions directed against infectious agents. Here, study of the orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans, such as variola, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, may be most important. Analysis of the experimental data, carried out in this review, allows to infer that variola virus and other orthopoxviruses possess an unexampled set of genes whose protein products efficiently modulate the manifold defense mechanisms of the host organisms compared with the viruses from other families.

30402252	Studies of nonhuman primates: key sources of data on zoonoses and microbiota	The genetic and morphologic similarities between primates and humans means that much information obtained from primates may be applied to humans, and vice versa. However, habitat loss, hunting and the continued presence of humans have a negative effect on the biology and behaviour of almost all nonhuman primates. Noninvasive methods such as stool collection are among the safest alternative ways to study the multiple aspects of the biology of primates. Many epidemiologic issues (e.g. pathogen detection, microbiota studies) may be easily studied using stool samples from primates. Primates are undoubtedly among the first candidates suspected of becoming the source of one of the next emerging epidemic of zoonotic origin, as has already been observed with HIV, malaria and monkeypox. The Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection in Marseille actively participates in the study, mostly epidemiologic, of nonhuman primates, using mostly stool samples.	6	Information Unavailable	Culturomics; faecal samples; great apes; microbiota; nonhuman primates; zoonoses	10.1016/j.nmni.2018.08.014	Davoust B, Levasseur A, Mediannikov O.

32741672	Short-term and longer-term protective immune responses generated by subunit vaccination with smallpox A33, B5, L1 or A27 proteins adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and CpG in mice challenged with vaccinia virus	Smallpox, a contagious and deadly disease caused by variola virus, was eradicated by a strategy that included vaccination with vaccinia virus, a live-virus vaccine. Because the threat of bioterrorism with smallpox persists and infections with zoonotic poxvirus infections like monkeypox continue, and there may be a time when an alternative vaccine platform is needed, recombinant-subunit vaccine strategies for poxviruses have been pursued. Our prior work focused on understanding the immune responses generated to vaccine-formulations containing the virus protein L1. In this work, we examine vaccine-formulations with additional key protein targets: A33 and B5 (components of the extracellular virus) and another protein on the mature virus (A27) adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide (AH) with and without CpG- oligonucleotide. Each vaccine was formulated to allow either adsorption or non-adsorption of the protein (and CpG) to AH. Mice given a prime and single boost produced long-lasting antibody responses. A second boost (given ~5-months after the first) further increased antibody titers. Similar to our prior findings with L1 vaccine-formulations, the most protective A33 vaccine-formulations included CpG, resulted in the generation of IgG2a-antibody responses. Unlike the prior findings with L1 (where formulations that adsorbed both the protein and the CpG to AH resulted in 100% survival after challenge and minimal weight loss), the AH-adsorption status of A33 and CpG did not play as important a role, since both AH-adsorbed and non-adsorbed groups lost weight after challenge and had similar survival. Vaccination with B5-formulations gave different results. While CpG-containing formulations were the only ones that generated IgG2a-antibody responses, the vaccine-formulation that adsorbed B5 to AH (without CpG) was as equally effective in protecting mice after challenge. These results indicate that the mechanism of how antibodies against A33 and B5 protect differ. The data also show the complexity of designing optimized vaccine-formulations containing multiple adjuvants and recombinant protein-based antigens.

6265114	Characterization of antibodies to orthopoxviruses in human sera by radioimmunoassay	Serological surveillance of suspected orthopoxvirus infections in man is important for confirming the success of the worldwide smallpox eradication programme. An adsorption radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to differentiate sera from patients who were naturally infected with human monkeypox or variola virus, and individuals who were immunized with vaccinia virus. The antisera were adsorbed with uninfected chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and vaccinia-infected CAM before reacting in RIA with vaccinia, monkeypox, and variola antigens. Each serum group showed characteristic patterns of residual antibody activity which made it possible to identify antibody specificities.When 45 human sera were tested by this method, 71% were identified as having vaccinia, variola, or monkeypox adsorption characteristics, while the remaining 29% could not be identified. Of the identified sera, 9 were characteristic of vaccinia, 8 of variola, and 15 of monkeypox. Six of the 15 monkeypox sera were virologically confirmed monkeypox infections, 6 were suspected monkeypox infections but were not virologically confirmed, and 3 were of unknown aetiology.The adsorption RIA provides a method of identifying serologically the poxvirus responsible for infection long after the acute phase of illness.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Walls HH, Ziegler DW, Nakano JH.

1656900	[Variola or a severe case of varicella? A case of human variola due to monkeypox virus in a child from the Cameroon]	Human monkeypox was suspected on clinical grounds in a seven years old child in Cameroon. The diagnosis was confirmed at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, USA. This condition is rare. The present case is the third in Cameroon. An epidemiological and clinical survey carried out in the family and in the area where the patient lives, did not allow to identify other cases. The clinical evolution of the case was good as in those described elsewhere.	5	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Tchokoteu PF, Kago I, Tetanye E, Ndoumbe P, Pignon D, Mbede J.

2998003	Orthopoxvirus DNA: a comparison of restriction profiles and maps	Characteristic DNA endonuclease digest fragment electropherograms and restriction site maps permitted differentiation and genome structure analysis of 38 orthopoxviruses that included isolates of monkeypox virus from humans and animals, monkeypox white variants, variola, vaccinia, ectromelia, Tatera (gerbil) and raccoon poxviruses, and cowpox and camelpox viruses. HindIII cleavage sites mapped on the 38 virus genome DNAs plus SmaI, BglI, SacI, KpnI, XhoI, and SalI maps for variola (Harvey) and monkeypox (Copenhagen) virus DNAs were derived essentially by cross-hybridizations with monkeypox, vaccinia, and variola virus-cloned DNA restriction fragments, thus digest fragments could be assigned homologous regions on previously established genome maps. Salient of our observations, the DNA HindIII maps correlated to a high degree, but variations in middle and especially terminal DNA region cleavage sites provided a basis for discerning species, strains and variants. The extent of the inverted terminal repetitions (ITRs) for 37 DNAs were determined with HindIII, PvuI, SalI, and ClaI, plus nine more restriction enzymes for Bangladesh variola virus DNA by hybridizations with either the terminal tandemly repeated 70-bp segment or an EcoRI-PvuI near hairpin-end 75-bp segment from WR vaccinia virus. The opposite terminal regions of variola DNA were considerably asymmetrical compared to the large symmetrical ITRs of the other species examined. An apparent DNA inversion and concurrent deletion (1 kbp) with subsequent repair of DNA to original structure was suggested from right terminal region maps of four viruses chosen from a variola virus passage series in monkeys. Correlative with virus geographic distribution, two strains of monkeypox virus, each containing two variants, were differentiated by DNA profiles of isolates from smallpox-like disease (SLD) patients of the African rainforest region. The DNAs of five monkeypox viruses isolated from laboratory and zoo animals resembled most DNAs from SLD monkeypox viruses from Sierra Leone. A poxvirus from an American raccoon contained 40% DNA that did not cross-hybridize with orthopoxvirus DNA probes. The DNAs of recent isolates from a gerbil and from a camel each mapped as unique African orthopoxvirus species and differed from variola virus.	63	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0042-6822(85)90111-4	Esposito JJ, Knight JC.

For real-time PCR, the following pairs of fluorophore and a fluorescence quencher were used: TAMRA-BHQ2 for genus-specific probes and FAM-BHQ1 for species-specific ones (variola virus, monkeypox virus, ectomelia virus).

23307378	Serologic evidence for circulating orthopoxviruses in peridomestic rodents from rural Uganda	The prevalence of orthopoxviruses (OPXV) among wildlife, including monkeypox virus (MPXV), remains largely unknown. Outbreaks of human monkeypox in central Africa have been associated with hunting, butchering, and consuming infected forest animals, primarily rodents and primates. Monkeypox cases have not been reported in east Africa, where human contact with wildlife is more limited. Whether this lack of human disease is due to the absence of MPXV in rodents is unknown. However, testing of wildlife beyond the known geographic distribution of human cases of monkeypox has rarely been conducted, limiting our knowledge of the natural distribution of MPXV and other OPXV. To improve our understanding of the natural distribution of OPXV in Africa and related risks to public health, we conducted a serosurvey of peridomestic rodents (Rattus rattus) in and around traditional dwellings in Kabarole District, Uganda, from May 2008 to July 2008. We tested for OPXV antibody in areas free of human monkeypox. Sera from 41% of the R. rattus individuals sampled reacted to OPXV-specific proteins from multiple, purified OPXV samples, but did not react by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The specific OPXV could not be identified because poxvirus DNA was undetectable in corresponding tissues. We conclude that an OPXV or a similar poxvirus is circulating among wild rodents in Uganda. With the known geographic range of OPXV in rodents now increased, factors that dictate OPXV prevalence and disease will be identified.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.7589/2012-04-100	Salzer JS, Carroll DS, Rwego IB, Li Y, Falendysz EA, Shisler JL, Karem KL, Damon IK, Gillespie TR.

22225618	Antiviral activity of the EB peptide against zoonotic poxviruses	Background: The EB peptide is a 20-mer that was previously shown to have broad spectrum in vitro activity against several unrelated viruses, including highly pathogenic avian influenza, herpes simplex virus type I, and vaccinia, the prototypic orthopoxvirus. To expand on this work, we evaluated EB for in vitro activity against the zoonotic orthopoxviruses cowpox and monkeypox and for in vivo activity in mice against vaccinia and cowpox. Findings: In yield reduction assays, EB had an EC50 of 26.7 μM against cowpox and 4.4 μM against monkeypox. The EC50 for plaque reduction was 26.3 μM against cowpox and 48.6 μM against monkeypox. A scrambled peptide had no inhibitory activity against either virus. EB inhibited cowpox in vitro by disrupting virus entry, as evidenced by a reduction of the release of virus cores into the cytoplasm. Monkeypox was also inhibited in vitro by EB, but at the attachment stage of infection. EB showed protective activity in mice infected intranasally with vaccinia when co-administered with the virus, but had no effect when administered prophylactically one day prior to infection or therapeutically one day post-infection. EB had no in vivo activity against cowpox in mice. Conclusions: While EB did demonstrate some in vivo efficacy against vaccinia in mice, the limited conditions under which it was effective against vaccinia and lack of activity against cowpox suggest EB may be more useful for studying orthopoxvirus entry and attachment in vitro than as a therapeutic against orthopoxviruses in vivo.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-9-6	Altmann SE, Brandt CR, Jahrling PB, Blaney JE.

24943381	Matched longitudinal analysis of biomarkers associated with survival	The identification of host or pathogen factors linked to clinical outcome is a common goal in many animal studies of infectious diseases. When the disease is fatal, statistical analysis of such factors may be biased from missing observations due to deaths. For example, when observations of a subject are censored before completing the intended study period, the complete trajectory will not be observed. Even if the factor is not associated with outcome, comparisons of data from survivors with those from nonsurvivors may lead to the wrong conclusions regarding associations with survival. Comparisons between subjects must account for differing observation lengths for those who survive relative to those who do not. Analyzing data over an interval common to all subjects provides one solution but requires eliminating data, some of which may be informative about the differences between groups. Here, we present a novel approach, matched longitudinal analysis (MLA), for analyzing such data based on matching biomarker intervals for survivors and nonsurvivors. We describe the results from simulation studies and from a study of monkeypox virus infection in nonhuman primates. In our application, MLA identified low monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels as having a statistically significant association with survival, whereas the alternative methods did not identify an association. The method has general application to longitudinal studies that seek to find associations of biomarker changes with survival.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/CVI.00252-14	Dodd LE, Johnson RF, Blaney JE, Follmann D.

24832205	T cell inactivation by poxviral B22 family proteins increases viral virulence	Infections with monkeypox, cowpox and weaponized variola virus remain a threat to the increasingly unvaccinated human population, but little is known about their mechanisms of virulence and immune evasion. We now demonstrate that B22 proteins, encoded by the largest genes of these viruses, render human T cells unresponsive to stimulation of the T cell receptor by MHC-dependent antigen presentation or by MHC-independent stimulation. In contrast, stimuli that bypass TCR-signaling are not inhibited. In a non-human primate model of monkeypox, virus lacking the B22R homologue (MPXVΔ197) caused only mild disease with lower viremia and cutaneous pox lesions compared to wild type MPXV which caused high viremia, morbidity and mortality. Since MPXVΔ197-infected animals displayed accelerated T cell responses and less T cell dysregulation than MPXV US2003, we conclude that B22 family proteins cause viral virulence by suppressing T cell control of viral dissemination.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1004123	Alzhanova D, Hammarlund E, Reed J, Meermeier E, Rawlings S, Ray CA, Edwards DM, Bimber B, Legasse A, Planer S, Sprague J, Axthelm MK, Pickup DJ, Lewinsohn DM, Gold MC, Wong SW, Sacha JB, Slifka MK, Früh K.

24563659	Orthopoxvirus inhibitors that are active in animal models: an update from 2008 to 2012	Antiviral agents are being sought as countermeasures for the potential deliberate release of smallpox (variola) and monkeypox viruses, for the treatment of naturally acquired monkeypox virus infections, and as therapy for complications due to smallpox (live-attenuated vaccinia virus) vaccination or accidental infection after exposure to vaccinated persons. Reviews of the scientific literature spanning 1950-2008 have documented the progress made in developing small-animal models of poxvirus infection and identifying novel antiviral agents. Compounds of considerable interest include cidofovir, CMX001 and ST-246® (tecovirimat; SIGA Technologies, NY, USA). New inhibitors have been identified since 2008, most of which do not exhibit the kind of potency and selectivity required for drug development. Two promising agents include 4'-thioidoxuridine (a nucleoside analog) and mDEF201 (an adenovirus-vectored interferon). Compounds that have been effectively used in combination studies include vaccinia immune globulin, cidofovir, ST-246 and CMX001. In the future there may be an increase in experimental work using active compounds in combination.	8	Information Unavailable	antiviral; camelpox; cowpox; drug combinations; ectromelia; monkeypox; rabbitpox; smallpox; vaccinia	10.2217/fvl.13.76	Smee DF.

22899927	Orthopoxvirus genes that mediate disease virulence and host tropism	In the course of evolution, viruses have developed various molecular mechanisms to evade the defense reactions of the host organism. When understanding the mechanisms used by viruses to overcome manifold defense systems of the animal organism, represented by molecular factors and cells of the immune system, we would not only comprehend better but also discover new patterns of organization and function of these most important reactions directed against infectious agents. Here, study of the orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans, such as variola (smallpox), monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, may be most important. Analysis of the experimental data, presented in this paper, allows to infer that variola virus and other orthopoxviruses possess an unexampled set of genes whose protein products efficiently modulate the manifold defense mechanisms of the host organisms compared with the viruses from other families.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1155/2012/524743	Shchelkunov SN.

During the 1970th and 80th, many new agents were characterized from diagnostic cell cultures and clinical specimens. The wide introduction of ELISA- and PCR-techniques as well as cost-arguments recently reduced the role of EM in routine viral diagnosis. Compared to other diagnostic techniques, however, EM excells by speed and ""open view"", i.e. by the ability to detect also the ""un-expected"" without the need for specific reagents. As shown in 2003 by the elucidation of the SARS pandemia and the human monkeypox outbreak in US, EM is well suited as a safe, front-line diagnostic method in infectious diseases emergencies and/or in possible bioterrorist attacks."	9	Review	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Gentile M, Gelderblom HR.

19727418	Therapeutic and prophylactic drugs to treat orthopoxvirus infections	With the global eradication of smallpox in 1979, the causative agent, variola, no longer circulates in human populations. Other human poxvirus infections, such as those caused by vaccinia, cowpox virus and molluscum, are usually relatively benign in immunocompetent individuals. Conversely, monkeypox virus infections cause high levels of mortality and morbidity in Africa and the virus appears to be increasing its host range, virulence and demographic environs. Furthermore, there are concerns that clandestine stocks of variola virus exist. The re-introduction of aerosolized variola (or perhaps monkeypox virus) into human populations would result in high levels of morbidity and mortality. The attractiveness of variola as a bioweapon and, to a certain extent, monkeypox virus is its inherent ability to spread from person-to-person. The threat posed by the intentional release of variola or monkeypox virus, or a monkeypox virus epizoonosis, will require the capacity to rapidly diagnose the disease and to intervene with antivirals, as intervention is likely to take place during the initial diagnosis, approximately 10-15 days postinfection. Preimmunization of 'at-risk populations' with vaccines will likely not be practical, and the therapeutic use of vaccines has been shown to be ineffective after 4 days of infection with variola. However, a combination of vaccine and antivirals for those infected may be an option. Here we describe historical, current and future therapies to treat orthopoxvirus diseases.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.2217/17460794.3.6.595	Parker S, Handley L, Buller RM.

20353691	Management and care of African dormice (Graphiurus kelleni)	African dormice (Graphiurus spp.) are small nocturnal rodents that currently are uncommon in laboratory settings. Their use may increase as they have recently been shown to develop an infection with monkeypox virus and may prove to be a valuable animal model for infectious disease research. Because African dormice are not commercially available, an extensive breeding colony is required to produce the animals needed for research use. Husbandry modifications that increased the production of offspring were the use of a high-protein diet, increased cage enrichment, and decreased animal density. To optimize consumption of a high-protein diet, we tested the palatability of several high-protein foods in a series of preference trials. Dormice preferred wax worm larva, cottage cheese, roasted soy nuts, and canned chicken. Issues related to medical management of Graphiurus kelleni include potential complications from traumatic injury. The development of a program for the husbandry and care of African dormice at our institution typifies the experiences of many laboratory animal facilities that are asked to support the development of animal models using novel species.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Kastenmayer RJ, Moak HB, Jeffress EJ, Elkins WR.

23809939	Orthopoxvirus variola infection of Cynomys ludovicianus (North American black tailed prairie dog)	Since the eradication of Smallpox, researchers have attempted to study Orthopoxvirus pathogenesis and immunity in animal models in order to correlate results human smallpox. A solely human pathogen, Orthopoxvirus variola fails to produce authentic smallpox illness in any other animal species tested to date. In 2003, an outbreak in the USA of Orthopoxvirus monkeypox, revealed the susceptibility of the North American black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) to infection and fulminate disease. Prairie dogs infected with Orthopoxvirus monkeypox present with a clinical scenario similar to ordinary smallpox, including prodrome, rash, and high mortality. This study examines if Black-tailed prairie dogs can become infected with O. variola and serve as a surrogate model for the study of human smallpox disease. Substantive evidence of infection is found in immunological seroconversion of animals to either intranasal or intradermal challenges with O. variola, but in the absence of overt illness.	2	Information Unavailable	Animal model; Immunity; Infection; Orthopoxvirus; Prairie dog; Smallpox; Variola	10.1016/j.virol.2013.05.029	Carroll DS, Olson VA, Smith SK, Braden ZH, Patel N, Abel J, Li Y, Damon IK, Karem KL.

25356657	Detecting differential transmissibilities that affect the size of self-limited outbreaks	Our ability to respond appropriately to infectious diseases is enhanced by identifying differences in the potential for transmitting infection between individuals. Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i.e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying [0 < R eff < 1) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis is based on a branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, pre-eradication smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that R eff has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in R eff, suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases. Lastly, we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human-to-human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross-protective smallpox vaccination. Our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source, vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self-limited transmission.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1004452	Blumberg S, Funk S, Pulliam JR.

26086739	BoHV-4-Based Vector Single Heterologous Antigen Delivery Protects STAT1(-/-) Mice from Monkeypoxvirus Lethal Challenge	Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of human (MPX). It is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1(-/-) mice against mortality and morbidity. This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pntd.0003850	Franceschi V, Parker S, Jacca S, Crump RW, Doronin K, Hembrador E, Pompilio D, Tebaldi G, Estep RD, Wong SW, Buller MR, Donofrio G.

The efficacy analysis combined the data from studies conducted at three separate facilities that evaluated treatment following infection with a closely related virus, monkeypox virus (MPXV), in a total of 96 NHPs. The effect of infection on ST-246 pharmacokinetics in NHPs was applied to humans using population pharmacokinetic models.

25100640	Inactivation of bacterial and viral biothreat agents on metallic copper surfaces	In recent years several studies in laboratory settings and in hospital environments have demonstrated that surfaces of massive metallic copper have intrinsic antibacterial and antiviral properties. Microbes are rapidly inactivated by a quick, sharp shock known as contact killing. The underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood; however, in this process the cytoplasmic membrane is severely damaged. Pathogenic bacterial and viral high-consequence species able to evade the host immune system are among the most serious lethal microbial challenges to human health. Here, we investigated contact-killing mediated by copper surfaces of Gram-negative bacteria (Brucella melitensis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Francisella tularensis tularensis and Yersinia pestis) and of Gram-positive endospore-forming Bacillus anthracis. Additionally, we also tested inactivation of monkeypox virus and vaccinia virus on copper. This group of pathogens comprises biothreat species (or their close relatives) classified by the Center for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) as microbial select agents posing severe threats to public health and having the potential to be deliberately released. All agents were rapidly inactivated on copper between 30 s and 5 min with the exception of B. anthracis endospores. For vegetative bacterial cells prolonged contact to metallic copper resulted in the destruction of cell structure.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1007/s10534-014-9781-0	Bleichert P, Espírito Santo C, Hanczaruk M, Meyer H, Grass G.

22035219	Serologic evidence of human orthopoxvirus infections in Sierra Leone	Background: Orthopoxviruses, including variola virus, vaccinia virus, and monkeypox virus, have previously been documented in humans in West Africa, however, no cases of human orthopoxvirus infection have been reported in the region since 1986. We conducted a serosurvey to determine whether human exposure to orthopoxviruses continues to occur in eastern Sierra Leone. Findings: To examine evidence of exposure to orthopoxviruses in the Kenema District of Sierra Leone, we collected and tested sera from 1596 persons by IgG ELISA and a subset of 313 by IgM capture ELISA. Eleven persons born after the cessation of smallpox vaccination had high orthopoxvirus-specific IgG values, and an additional 6 persons had positive IgM responses. No geographic clustering was noted. Conclusions: These data suggest that orthopoxviruses continue to circulate in Sierra Leone. Studies aimed at obtaining orthopoxvirus isolates and/or genetic sequences from rodents and symptomatic humans in the area are indicated.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1756-0500-4-465	Macneil A, Abel J, Reynolds MG, Lash R, Fonnie R, Kanneh LD, Robert W, Lungay VK, Goba A, Moses LM, Damon IK, Karem K, Bausch DG.

26930499	Development of a Genus-Specific Antigen Capture ELISA for Orthopoxviruses - Target Selection and Optimized Screening	Orthopoxvirus species like cowpox, vaccinia and monkeypox virus cause zoonotic infections in humans worldwide. Infections often occur in rural areas lacking proper diagnostic infrastructure as exemplified by monkeypox, which is endemic in Western and Central Africa. While PCR detection requires demanding equipment and is restricted to genome detection, the evidence of virus particles can complement or replace PCR. Therefore, an easily distributable and manageable antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of orthopoxviruses was developed to facilitate particle detection. By comparing the virus particle binding properties of polyclonal antibodies developed against surface-exposed attachment or fusion proteins, the surface protein A27 was found to be a well-bound, highly immunogenic and exposed target for antibodies aiming at virus particle detection. Subsequently, eight monoclonal anti-A27 antibodies were generated and characterized by peptide epitope mapping and surface plasmon resonance measurements. All antibodies were found to bind with high affinity to two epitopes at the heparin binding site of A27, toward either the N- or C-terminal of the crucial KKEP-segment of A27. Two antibodies recognizing different epitopes were implemented in an antigen capture ELISA. Validation showed robust detection of virus particles from 11 different orthopoxvirus isolates pathogenic to humans, with the exception of MVA, which is apathogenic to humans. Most orthopoxviruses could be detected reliably for viral loads above 1 × 103 PFU/mL. To our knowledge, this is the first solely monoclonal and therefore reproducible antibody-based antigen capture ELISA able to detect all human pathogenic orthopoxviruses including monkeypox virus, except variola virus which was not included. Therefore, the newly developed antibody-based assay represents important progress towards feasible particle detection of this important genus of viruses.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0150110	Stern D, Pauly D, Zydek M, Miller L, Piesker J, Laue M, Lisdat F, Dorner MB, Dorner BG, Nitsche A.

2570511	Monkey pox in humans: current results	The presented studies were performed at the WHO Collaboration Center for Smallpox in Moscow in the framework of the WHO monkey pox project. The authors recommend improved methods for rapid detection of orthopoxvirus antigen, namely passive haemagglutination (PHA) using dried stable red blood cells and ELISA in order to provide more rapid and efficient laboratory diagnosis under field conditions. Independent serologic diagnosis of monkey pox by ELISA-adsorption (ELISA-A) was proved of value for epidemiological studies and for detection of inapparent infections. The application range of the latter technique and its limitations were also determined.

28606813	Comparative Efficacy of Intramuscular and Scarification Routes of Administration of Live Smallpox Vaccine in a Murine Challenge Model	In recent years concern has mounted regarding the possibility of a re-emergence of smallpox through biowarfare or bioterrorism. There is also concern over the incidence of human monkeypox in endemic areas and the potential for monkeypox to be accidentally transported to non-endemic areas. In the event of re-emergence of smallpox or emergence of monkeypox, the accepted route of administration for live replicating smallpox vaccine is dermal scarification, which generates a virus-shedding lesion that persists for several days at the vaccination site. The lesion is a potential source of contact transmission of vaccine to individuals who may be contra-indicated for receipt of the live vaccine. In this study, we compare dermal scarification with intramuscular vaccination for replicating smallpox vaccine in a mouse lethal challenge model. Comparisons are made over multiple vaccine and challenge doses and data recorded for lethality, disease severity, and antibody responses. Qualitative and quantitative differences between the two routes are observed, and for the intramuscular route the febrile response is not suppressed after subsequent virulent vaccinia virus challenge. However both routes generate an immune response and protect from severe disease and death. Although dermal scarification is the preferred route of vaccination for the general population, intramuscular vaccination may be an option for people who are not contraindicated for the live vaccine, but who are close contacts of people who are contraindicated for the live vaccine, in an emergency situation.	5	Comparative Study	Febrile response; Intramuscular vaccination; Monkeypox; Smallpox; Vaccinia	10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.058	Phelps A, Gates AJ, Eastaugh L, Hillier M, Ulaeto DO.

19183487	A method for statistically comparing spatial distribution maps	Background: Ecological niche modeling is a method for estimation of species distributions based on certain ecological parameters. Thus far, empirical determination of significant differences between independently generated distribution maps for a single species (maps which are created through equivalent processes, but with different ecological input parameters), has been challenging. Results: We describe a method for comparing model outcomes, which allows a statistical evaluation of whether the strength of prediction and breadth of predicted areas is measurably different between projected distributions. To create ecological niche models for statistical comparison, we utilized GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production) software to generate ecological niche models of human monkeypox in Africa. We created several models, keeping constant the case location input records for each model but varying the ecological input data. In order to assess the relative importance of each ecological parameter included in the development of the individual predicted distributions, we performed pixel-to-pixel comparisons between model outcomes and calculated the mean difference in pixel scores. We used a two sample Student's t-test, (assuming as null hypothesis that both maps were identical to each other regardless of which input parameters were used) to examine whether the mean difference in corresponding pixel scores from one map to another was greater than would be expected by chance alone. We also utilized weighted kappa statistics, frequency distributions, and percent difference to look at the disparities in pixel scores. Multiple independent statistical tests indicated precipitation as the single most important independent ecological parameter in the niche model for human monkeypox disease. Conclusion: In addition to improving our understanding of the natural factors influencing the distribution of human monkeypox disease, such pixel-to-pixel comparison tests afford users the ability to empirically distinguish the significance of each of the diverse environmental parameters included in the modeling process. This method will be particularly useful in situations where the outcomes (maps) appear similar upon visual inspection (as are generated with other modeling programs such as MAXENT), as it allows an investigator the capacity to explore subtle differences among ecological parameters and to demonstrate the individual importance of these factors within an overall model.	3	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1476-072X-8-7	Levine RS, Yorita KL, Walsh MC, Reynolds MG.

25597343	The Possibility of Using the ICR Mouse as an Animal Model to Assess Antimonkeypox Drug Efficacy	As a result of the conducted experimental studies on intranasal challenge of ICR mice, rabbits and miniature pigs (even in the maximum variant) with the doses of 4.0-5.5 lg PFU of monkeypox virus (MPXV), some clinical signs such as purulent conjunctivitis, blepharitis and ruffled fur were found only in mice. The 50% infective dose (C ID50 ) of MPXV for these animals estimated by the presence of external clinical signs was 4.8 lg PFU, and L ID50 estimated by the virus presence in the lungs of mice 7 days post-infection taking into account its 10% application in the animal respiratory tract was 1.4 lg PFU. When studying the dynamics of MPXV propagation in mice challenged intranasally with 25 L ID50 of MPXV, the maximum pathogen accumulation was revealed in nasal cavity, lungs and brain: 5.7 ± 0.1, 5.5 ± 0.1 and 5.3 ± 0.3 lg PFU/ml, respectively. The pathomorphological examination of these animals revealed the presence and replication of the pathogen in the traditional primary target cells for MPXV (mononuclear phagocyte system cells and respiratory tract epitheliocytes) as well as in some other types of cells (endothelial cells, reticular cells, connective tissue cells). Our use of these animals to assess the antiviral efficacy of some drugs demonstrated the agreement of the results (a significant positive effect of NIOCH-14 and ST-246) with those described in scientific literature, which opens up the prospects of using ICR mice as animal models for monkeypox to develop preventive antismallpox drugs.

23658504	Inference of R(0) and transmission heterogeneity from the size distribution of stuttering chains	For many infectious disease processes such as emerging zoonoses and vaccine-preventable diseases, [Formula: see text] and infections occur as self-limited stuttering transmission chains. A mechanistic understanding of transmission is essential for characterizing the risk of emerging diseases and monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics. Thus methods for inferring [Formula: see text] and the degree of heterogeneity in transmission from stuttering chain data have important applications in disease surveillance and management. Previous researchers have used chain size distributions to infer [Formula: see text], but estimation of the degree of individual-level variation in infectiousness (as quantified by the dispersion parameter, [Formula: see text]) has typically required contact tracing data. Utilizing branching process theory along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we demonstrate how maximum likelihood estimation can be applied to chain size data to infer both [Formula: see text] and the dispersion parameter that characterizes heterogeneity. While the maximum likelihood value for [Formula: see text] is a simple function of the average chain size, the associated confidence intervals are dependent on the inferred degree of transmission heterogeneity. As demonstrated for monkeypox data from the Democratic Republic of Congo, this impacts when a statistically significant change in [Formula: see text] is detectable. In addition, by allowing for superspreading events, inference of [Formula: see text] shifts the threshold above which a transmission chain should be considered anomalously large for a given value of [Formula: see text] (thus reducing the probability of false alarms about pathogen adaptation). Our analysis of monkeypox also clarifies the various ways that imperfect observation can impact inference of transmission parameters, and highlights the need to quantitatively evaluate whether observation is likely to significantly bias results.	78	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002993	Blumberg S, Lloyd-Smith JO.

25646658	Probing the virus host interaction in high containment: an approach using pooled short hairpin RNA	The study of viruses in high containment offers unique challenges for technology-intense approaches. These approaches include high-throughput screening for small-molecule antivirals and genetic perturbation-based screens for host factors required for viral replication. Here, we describe the use of whole-genome scale pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries to screen for host factors necessary for viral infection at BSL2, and the transition of this technique into the BSL4 environment. Pooled screening provides a unique way to circumvent many of the technological challenges associated with other high-throughput screening approaches in high containment. Our pooled screening approach identified host factors involved in the replication of orthopoxviruses (Vaccinia and Monkeypox) and filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) under conditions that enable straightforward screen-to-follow-up approaches.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1089/adt.2014.613	Filone CM, Dower K, Cowley GS, Hensley LE, Connor JH.

30996093	A Genome-Wide Haploid Genetic Screen Identifies Heparan Sulfate-Associated Genes and the Macropinocytosis Modulator TMED10 as Factors Supporting Vaccinia Virus Infection	Vaccinia virus is a promising viral vaccine and gene delivery candidate and has historically been used as a model to study poxvirus-host cell interactions. We employed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis approach in human haploid cells to identify host factors crucial for vaccinia virus infection. A library of mutagenized HAP1 cells was exposed to modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). Deep-sequencing analysis of virus-resistant cells identified host factors involved in heparan sulfate synthesis, Golgi organization, and vesicular protein trafficking. We validated EXT1, TM9SF2, and TMED10 (TMP21/p23/p24δ) as important host factors for vaccinia virus infection. The critical roles of EXT1 in heparan sulfate synthesis and vaccinia virus infection were confirmed. TM9SF2 was validated as a player mediating heparan sulfate expression, explaining its contribution to vaccinia virus infection. In addition, TMED10 was found to be crucial for virus-induced plasma membrane blebbing and phosphatidylserine-induced macropinocytosis, presumably by regulating the cell surface expression of the TAM receptor Axl.IMPORTANCE Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that can infect a wide range of host species. A number of these viruses are clinically important to humans, including variola virus (smallpox) and vaccinia virus. Since the eradication of smallpox, zoonotic infections with monkeypox virus and cowpox virus are emerging. Additionally, poxviruses can be engineered to specifically target cancer cells and are used as a vaccine vector against tuberculosis, influenza, and coronaviruses. Poxviruses rely on host factors for most stages of their life cycle, including attachment to the cell and entry. These host factors are crucial for virus infectivity and host cell tropism. We used a genome-wide knockout library of host cells to identify host factors necessary for vaccinia virus infection. We confirm a dominant role for heparin sulfate in mediating virus attachment. Additionally, we show that TMED10, previously not implicated in virus infections, facilitates virus uptake by modulating the cellular response to phosphatidylserine.	13	Information Unavailable	TMED10; genome-wide screen; heparan sulfate; macropinocytosis; phosphatidylserine; poxvirus; vaccinia virus	10.1128/JVI.02160-18	Luteijn RD, van Diemen F, Blomen VA, Boer IGJ, Manikam Sadasivam S, van Kuppevelt TH, Drexler I, Brummelkamp TR, Lebbink RJ, Wiertz EJ.

21450994	Smallpox vaccine safety is dependent on T cells and not B cells	The licensed smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, is a cell culture derivative of Dryvax. Both ACAM2000 and Dryvax are administered by skin scarification and can cause progressive vaccinia, with skin lesions that disseminate to distal sites. We have investigated the immunologic basis of the containment of vaccinia in the skin with the goal to identify safer vaccines for smallpox. Macaques were depleted systemically of T or B cells and vaccinated with either Dryvax or an attenuated vaccinia vaccine, LC16m8. B cell depletion did not affect the size of skin lesions induced by either vaccine. However, while depletion of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells had no adverse effects on LC16m8-vaccinated animals, it caused progressive vaccinia in macaques immunized with Dryvax. As both Dryvax and LC16m8 vaccines protect healthy macaques from a lethal monkeypox intravenous challenge, our data identify LC16m8 as a safer and effective alternative to ACAM2000 and Dryvax vaccines for immunocompromised individuals.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/infdis/jiq162	Gordon SN, Cecchinato V, Andresen V, Heraud JM, Hryniewicz A, Parks RW, Venzon D, Chung HK, Karpova T, McNally J, Silvera P, Reimann KA, Matsui H, Kanehara T, Shinmura Y, Yokote H, Franchini G.

21921208	Safety and immunogenicity of LC16m8, an attenuated smallpox vaccine in vaccinia-naive adults	Introduction: LC16m8 is an attenuated cell culture-adapted Lister vaccinia smallpox vaccine missing the B5R protein and licensed for use in Japan. Methods: We conducted a phase I/II clinical trial that compared the safety and immunogenicity of LC16m8 with Dryvax in vaccinia-naive participants. Adverse events were assessed, as were electrocardiography and laboratory testing for cardiotoxicity and viral culturing of the vaccination sites. Neutralization titers to vaccinia, monkeypox, and variola major were assessed and cell-mediated immune responses were measured by interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot and lymphoproliferation assays. Results: Local and systemic reactions after vaccination with LC16m8 were similar to those reported after Dryvax. No clinically significant abnormalities consistent with cardiac toxicity were seen for either vaccine. Both vaccines achieved antivaccinia, antivariola, and antimonkeypox neutralizing antibody titers >1:40, although the mean plaque reduction neutralization titer of LC16m8 at day 30 after vaccination was significantly lower than Dryvax for anti-NYCBH vaccinia (P < .01), antimonkeypox (P < .001), and antivariola (P < .001). LC16m8 produced robust cellular immune responses that trended higher than Dryvax for lymphoproliferation (P = .06), but lower for IFN-γ ELISPOT (P = .02). Conclusions: LC16m8 generates neutralizing antibody titers to multiple poxviruses, including vaccinia, monkeypox, and variola major, and broad T-cell responses, indicating that LC16m8 may have efficacy in protecting individuals from smallpox.

16311375	Emerging zoonotic epidemics in the interconnected global community	The rate at which epidemics of zoonotic disease in humans have surfaced over the past 25 years has shaken--some would say shattered--the assumption that zoonotic diseases are under control, says Paul Gibbs.

23798698	Vacated niches, competitive release and the community ecology of pathogen eradication	A recurring theme in the epidemiological literature on disease eradication is that each pathogen occupies an ecological niche, and eradication of one pathogen leaves a vacant niche that favours the emergence of new pathogens to replace it. However, eminent figures have rejected this view unequivocally, stating that there is no basis to fear pathogen replacement and even that pathogen niches do not exist. After exploring the roots of this controversy, I propose resolutions to disputed issues by drawing on broader ecological theory, and advance a new consensus based on robust mechanistic principles. I argue that pathogen eradication (and cessation of vaccination) leads to a 'vacated niche', which could be re-invaded by the original pathogen if introduced. Consequences for other pathogens will vary, with the crucial mechanisms being competitive release, whereby the decline of one species allows its competitors to perform better, and evolutionary adaptation. Hence, eradication can cause a quantitative rise in the incidence of another infection, but whether this leads to emergence as an endemic pathogen depends on additional factors. I focus on the case study of human monkeypox and its rise following smallpox eradication, but also survey how these ideas apply to other pathogens and discuss implications for eradication policy.	33	Information Unavailable	competitive release; ecological niche; emerging infectious disease; monkeypox; pathogen eradication; zoonosis	10.1098/rstb.2012.0150	Lloyd-Smith JO.

17426185	Efficacy of the antipoxvirus compound ST-246 for treatment of severe orthopoxvirus infection	Efficacy of the new antipoxvirus compound ST-246 was evaluated as treatment of monkeypox (MPX) virus infection in a ground squirrel model of the disease. Ground squirrels were given a lethal dose of MPX virus and were then treated orally at various times post-inoculation (pi) with 100 mg/kg/day of ST-246. Morbidity and mortality, clinical laboratory results, viral load, and pathology of placebo and treatment groups were compared. All animals that started treatment with ST-246 on days 0, 1, 2, and 3 pi survived lethal challenge with MPX virus; 67% of animals treated on day 4 pi also survived. In contrast, 100% of the placebo group died. Most of the ST-246-treated animals showed no evidence of clinical disease or alteration of baseline clinical laboratory values and had minimal histopathologic changes. These results suggest that ST-246 is a promising candidate for early treatment of severe orthopoxvirus infection.	40	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Sbrana E, Jordan R, Hruby DE, Mateo RI, Xiao SY, Siirin M, Newman PC, DA Rosa AP, Tesh RB.

6252467	The confirmation and maintenance of smallpox eradication	In December 1979, an independent scientific commission certified global eradication of smallpox. This conclusion was accepted at the 33d World Health Assembly of the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 1980. After WHO's intensified eradication program began in 1967, special certification procedures were used in 35 countries where the disease had been endemic and in 44 others at special risk. Six laboratories are known to retain variola virus; efforts have been made to ensure strict containment of these strains. There is no evidence that smallpox will recur as an endemic disease. Nevertheless, WHO will promote surveillance of smallpox-like disease and selected laboratory research on certain orthopoxviruses. These efforts will maintain confidence that smallpox has been eradicated and confirm that there are no animal reservoirs of variola virus. A more complete understanding of the orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox virus, should also be obtained.	54	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1056/NEJM198011273032204	Breman JG, Arita I.

20951746	Nigericin is a potent inhibitor of the early stage of vaccinia virus replication	Poxviruses remain a significant public health concern due to their potential use as bioterrorist agents and the spread of animal borne poxviruses, such as monkeypox virus, to humans. Thus, the identification of small molecule inhibitors of poxvirus replication is warranted. Vaccinia virus is the prototypic member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which also includes variola and monkeypox virus. In this study, we demonstrate that the carboxylic ionophore nigericin is a potent inhibitor of vaccinia virus replication in several human cell lines. In HeLa cells, we found that the 50% inhibitory concentration of nigericin against vaccinia virus was 7.9 nM, with a selectivity index of 1038. We present data demonstrating that nigericin targets vaccinia virus replication at a post-entry stage. While nigericin moderately inhibits both early vaccinia gene transcription and translation, viral DNA replication and intermediate and late gene expression are severely compromised in the presence of nigericin. Our results demonstrate that nigericin has the potential to be further developed into an effective antiviral to treat poxvirus infections.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.10.001	Myskiw C, Piper J, Huzarewich R, Booth TF, Cao J, He R.

21810533	An epitope conserved in orthopoxvirus A13 envelope protein is the target of neutralizing and protective antibodies	Primary immunization of humans with smallpox vaccine (live vaccinia virus (VACV)) consistently elicits antibody responses to six VACV virion membrane proteins, including A13. However, whether anti-A13 antibody contributes to immune protection against orthopoxviruses was unknown. Here, we isolated a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) against A13 from a mouse that had been infected with VACV. The anti-A13 mAb bound to recombinant A13 protein with an affinity of 3.4nM and neutralized VACV mature virions. Passive immunization of mice with the anti-A13 mAb protected against intranasal VACV infection. The epitope of the anti-A13 mAb was mapped to a 10-amino acid sequence conserved in all orthopoxviruses, including viriola virus and monkeypox virus, suggesting that anti-A13 antibodies elicited by smallpox vaccine might contribute to immune protection against orthopoxviruses. In addition, our data demonstrates that anti-A13 mAbs are effective for treating orthopoxvirus infection.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.029	Xu C, Meng X, Yan B, Crotty S, Deng J, Xiang Y.

191209	Poxvirus infection of the baboon (Papio cynocephalus)	Ten serial passages of monkeypox (MPV), vaccinia, variola, and chimpanzeepox (chimp-9) viruses were performed in baboons (Papio cynocephalus) via skin scarification. Comparisons of clinical and virological results indicate that MPV and vaccinia are very closely related and that variola and chimp-9 viruses are identical. These findings suggest that infections of simians with chimp-9 virus resulted from contact with variola virus, the source of which is still unknown. On the other hand, MPV in monkeys may have resulted from contact with recently vaccinated humans, serial passage through simian hosts resulting in the biological alterations that produced MPV.	5	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Heberling RL, Kalter SS, Rodriguez AR.

19043920	Using biomarkers to stage disease progression in a lethal mousepox model treated with CMX001	Background: The emergence of human monkeypox and the potential use of recombinant variola and monkeypox viruses as biological terrorist agents have necessitated the development of therapeutic and prophylactic therapies. The primary, or index, cases of smallpox and/or human monkeypox will likely be identified by a characteristic rash. Effective biomarkers will be required to monitor disease progression, guide the choice of therapeutic intervention strategies and evaluate their efficacies. To address this we have evaluated several biomarkers of disease in a lethal mousepox model. Methods: The efficacy of a single dose of a hexadecyloxypropyl ester of cidofovir (CMX001) at 20, 25 and 30 mg/kg doses administered on days 4, 5, 6 and 7 post-infection was evaluated in A/Ncr mice intranasally infected with low doses of ectromelia virus (<20 plaque-forming units). Mice were monitored for weight loss, blood interferon-gamma levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, viral DNA copies and neutrophilia levels to stage disease progression. Results: We have used these biomarkers to establish the optimal dosing regimen for treatment and reveal that a single dose of 25 mg/kg of CMX001 can be efficacious at treating lethal mousepox when administered on days 4 or 5 post-infection. This dose significantly reduces ALT, interferon-gamma and DNA copies found in the blood of infected animals. Conclusions: A single dose regimen of CMX001 is efficacious at treating mousepox. Disease progression and antiviral efficacy can be monitored using several biomarkers that could readily be used in the case of a human monkeypox or smallpox outbreak.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Parker S, Schriewer J, Oberle C, Robertson A, Lanier R, Painter G, Buller RM.

21994714	Ectromelia virus infections of mice as a model to support the licensure of anti-orthopoxvirus therapeutics	"The absence of herd immunity to orthopoxviruses and the concern that variola or monkeypox viruses could be used for bioterroristic activities has stimulated the development of therapeutics and safer prophylactics. One major limitation in this process is the lack of accessible human orthopoxvirus infections for clinical efficacy trials; however, drug licensure can be based on orthopoxvirus animal challenge models as described in the ""Animal Efficacy Rule"". One such challenge model uses ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus, whose natural host is the mouse and is the etiological agent of mousepox. The genetic similarity of ectromelia virus to variola and monkeypox viruses, the common features of the resulting disease, and the convenience of the mouse as a laboratory animal underscores its utility in the study of orthopoxvirus pathogenesis and in the development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this review we outline how mousepox has been used as a model for smallpox. We also discuss mousepox in the context of mouse strain, route of infection, infectious dose, disease progression, and recovery from infection."	15	Information Unavailable	CMX001; ST-246; animal model; antiviral; ectromelia; infection route; monkeypox; mousepox; variola	10.3390/v2091918	Parker S, Siddiqui AM, Painter G, Schriewer J, Buller RM.

192091	Human poxvirus disease after smallpox eradication	A 5-year-old boy living in a small camp in the rural Ivory Coast had a disease resembling smallpox. This occurred 4 years after smallpox had been eradicated from the Ivory Coast and 1.5 years after the last case of smallpox was detected in West and Central Africa. Clinical, serological, and epidemiological evidence indicated this disease was probably monkeypox, a poxvirus of the variola/vaccina subgroup. A serologic survey of poxvirus antibodies in the wild animal population detected neutralizing antibodies in rodents, larger mammals, primates, and birds. The laboratory and ecological characteristics of poxviruses require further elucidation, especially those which have been found in animals near human monkeypox cases.	13	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.1977.26.273	Breman JG, Nakano JH, Coffi E, Godfrey H, Gautun JC.

811713	Isolation of poxvirus from an African Rodent	A poxvirus was isolated from a wild gerbil (Tatera kempii) caught in northern Dahomey, Africa at the time of an epidemic of human smallpox. Electron microscopic appearance and serologic reactions placed it in the vaccinia subgroup of poxviruses. The isolate differed from ectromelia, rabbitpox, vaccinia, monkeypox, and cowpox viruses in pock morphology on chorioallantoic membrane, ceiling temperature, relative innocuity for mice, and cytopathic effect in tissue culture. Like variola minor virus, it had a ceiling temperature of 38 C, produced small hypertrophic foci in tissue culture, and failed to grow in rabbit skin. Inoculated into a rhesus monkey, it caused fever but no skin eruption and produced seroconversion and protection from subsequent challenge with monkeypox virus. The growing list of animal viruses that differ only slightly from smallpox virus suggests the hypothesis that long-term survival of variola virus may be based on inapparent infection in animals as well as virulent spread among humans.	23	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/infdis/132.6.677	Lourie B, Nakano JH, Kemp GE, Setzer HW.

20509894	Comparative whole genome sequence analysis of wild-type and cidofovir-resistant monkeypoxvirus	We performed whole genome sequencing of a cidofovir {[(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy-propyl) cytosine] [HPMPC]}-resistant (CDV-R) strain of Monkeypoxvirus (MPV). Whole-genome comparison with the wild-type (WT) strain revealed 55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one tandem-repeat contraction. Over one-third of all identified SNPs were located within genes comprising the poxvirus replication complex, including the DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, mRNA capping methyltransferase, DNA processivity factor, and poly-A polymerase. Four polymorphic sites were found within the DNA polymerase gene. DNA polymerase mutations observed at positions 314 and 684 in MPV were consistent with CDV-R loci previously identified in Vaccinia virus (VACV). These data suggest the mechanism of CDV resistance may be highly conserved across Orthopoxvirus (OPV) species. SNPs were also identified within virulence genes such as the A-type inclusion protein, serine protease inhibitor-like protein SPI-3, Schlafen ATPase and thymidylate kinase, among others. Aberrant chain extension induced by CDV may lead to diverse alterations in gene expression and viral replication that may result in both adaptive and attenuating mutations. Defining the potential contribution of substitutions in the replication complex and RNA processing machinery reported here may yield further insight into CDV resistance and may augment current therapeutic development strategies.	8	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-7-110	Farlow J, Ichou MA, Huggins J, Ibrahim S.

The sensitivity of such analyses provides broad proteome characterization, but the sample-handling procedures must first be optimized to ensure compatibility with the technique and to maximize the dynamic range of detection. The decision-making process for determining optimal growth conditions, preparation methods, sample analysis methods, and data analysis techniques in our laboratory is discussed herein with consideration of the balance in sensitivity, specificity, and biomass losses during analysis of host-pathogen systems.	9	Information Unavailable	:mass spectrometry; methods; pathogens; proteomics; sample preparation	Information Unavailable	Mottaz-Brewer HM, Norbeck AD, Adkins JN, Manes NP, Ansong C, Shi L, Rikihisa Y, Kikuchi T, Wong SW, Estep RD, Heffron F, Pasa-Tolic L, Smith RD.

232137	Conservation and variation in Orthopoxvirus genome structure	Orthopoxvirus DNA from representative strains of rabbitpox, vaccinia, monkeypox, variola, cowpox and ectromelia viruses was analysed by cleavage with restriction endonucleases HindIII, XhoI or SmaI. Genome mol. wt. vary from about 120 x 10(6) for rabbitpox to about 145 x 10(6) for cowpox. Physical maps of cleavage sites are similar and characteristic for strains of the same Orthopoxvirus type. The distribution of HindIII sites suggests that an internal region of mol. wt. about 30 x 10(6) is highly conserved between Orthopoxvirus genomes although some type-specific differences occur within this region, especially with strains of ectromelia virus. Conservation of internal sequences is less marked following analysis with XhoI although cleavages within this central region of particular genomes appear to represent a subset of preferred sites. Endonuclease SmaI cleaves exceptionally infrequently and distinguishes variola, monkeypox, vaccinia, cowpox or ectromelia viruses. Type specific differences result largely from extensive, near terminal variations in length and sequence. Representative Orthopoxvirus genomes have rapidly renaturing terminal restriction fragments confirming the presence of near terminal, covalent cross-links. Terminal restriction fragments from the same or different genomes generally cross hybridize indicating the presence of near terminal repetitions of mol. wt. up to 6 x 10(6) and which share at least a subset of common sequences. Variola strains however, appear to lack such sequences from one specific terminus which maps shorter than that of related viruses.	59	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-45-3-683	Mackett M, Archard LC.

17332145	Real-time PCR to identify variola virus or other human pathogenic orthopox viruses	Background: Variola virus (family Poxviridae, genus Orthopoxvirus) and the closely related cowpox, vaccinia, and monkeypox viruses can infect humans. Efforts are mounting to replenish the smallpox vaccine stocks, optimize diagnostic methods for poxviruses, and develop new antivirals against smallpox, because it is feared that variola virus might be used as a weapon of bioterrorism. Methods: We developed an assay for the detection of variola virus DNA. The assay is based on TaqMan chemistry targeting the 14-kD protein gene. For the 1st stage of the assay we used genus consensus primers and a mixture of 2 probes (14-kD POX and 14-kD VAR) spanning the 14-kD protein-encoding gene for detection of all human pathogenic orthopoxviruses. We then tested positive samples with the specific orthopoxvirus-specific probe 14-kD POX to identify monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses and with the 14-kD VAR probe to identify variola viruses. The assay was established on 4 different PCR cycler platforms. It was assessed in a study with 85 different orthopoxvirus species and strains that included variola, camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses at concentrations ranging from 100 ng/L to 1 microg/L. Results: The assay detected as little as 0.05 fg of DNA, corresponding to 25 copies of DNA, and enabled differentiation of variola virus from the other orthopoxviruses. Conclusions: This real-time PCR assay provides a rapid method for the early detection and differentiation of smallpox and other human pathogenic orthopoxvirus infections.	17	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1373/clinchem.2006.068635	Scaramozzino N, Ferrier-Rembert A, Favier AL, Rothlisberger C, Richard S, Crance JM, Meyer H, Garin D.

16629503	Emerging infectious diseases at the beginning of the 21st century	The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases involves many interrelated factors. Global interconnectedness continues to increase with international travel and trade; economic, political, and cultural interactions; and human-to-human and animal-to-human interactions. These interactions include the accidental and deliberate sharing of microbial agents and antimicrobial resistance and allow the emergence of new and unrecognized microbial disease agents. As the 21st century begins, already new agents have been identified, and new outbreaks have occurred. Solutions to limiting the spread of emerging infectious diseases will require cooperative efforts among many disciplines and entities worldwide. This article defines emerging infectious diseases, summarizes historical background, and discusses factors that contribute to emergence. Seven agents that have made a significant appearance, particularly in the 21st century, are reviewed, including: Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, human monkeypox, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus, and avian influenza. The article provides for each agent a brief historical background, case descriptions, and health care implications.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Lashley FR.

29100534	Validation of a pan-orthopox real-time PCR assay for the detection and quantification of viral genomes from nonhuman primate blood	"Background: In 1980, smallpox disease was eradicated from nature and Variola virus, the etiological agent of smallpox, was confined to two laboratories, one located in Russia (Moscow) later moved to VECTOR (Novosibirsk, Siberia) and one in the United States (CDC Atlanta). Vaccinations among the general public ceased shortly after the successful eradication campaign, resulting in an increasingly immunologically susceptible population. Because of the possibility of intentional reintroduction of Variola virus and the emergence of other pathogenic poxviruses, there is a great need for the development of medical countermeasures to treat poxvirus disease. It is highly likely that the U.S. FDA ""animal rule"" will be necessary for regulatory approval of these interventions. Therefore, relevant animal models and the associated supporting assays will require development to stand up to regulatory scrutiny. Methods: An optimized real time PCR assay for the detection of orthopoxviruses has been developed by researchers at the United States Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). To support animal studies that will be used to support approval of medical countermeasures by the U.S. FDA, the assay was designed to quantitate poxvirus genomic DNA in a nonhuman primate (cynomolgus macaque) blood matrix as a measurement of viremia. This manuscript describes the validation of the process, including DNA extraction from whole blood anticoagulated with EDTA, for obtaining and quantitating monkeypox genomes by evaluating precision, accuracy, the standard curve, specificity, robustness and stability of the assay and/or components of the assay. Results: The assay had a lower limit of quantitation of 50 genome copies/5 uL sample, upper limit of quantitation of 5 × 107 GC/5uL sample and a limit of detection of 2.5 genome copies /5uL sample. The assay was specific for orthopoxvirus. Matrix effects were detected and suggest the presence of PCR inhibitor(s) that was co-extracted with the target DNA. Conclusions: The assay has been validated for the purpose of quantitating monkeypox viral load in blood from cynomolgus macaques. This assay has and will continue to support submissions to the FDA for approval of antiviral therapeutics for smallpox."

27466413	Retrograde Transport from Early Endosomes to the trans-Golgi Network Enables Membrane Wrapping and Egress of Vaccinia Virus Virions	The anterograde pathway, from the endoplasmic reticulum through the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface, is utilized by trans-membrane and secretory proteins. The retrograde pathway, which directs traffic in the opposite direction, is used following endocytosis of exogenous molecules and recycling of membrane proteins. Microbes exploit both routes: viruses typically use the anterograde pathway for envelope formation prior to exiting the cell, whereas ricin and Shiga-like toxins and some nonenveloped viruses use the retrograde pathway for cell entry. Mining a human genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen revealed a need for multiple retrograde pathway components for cell-to-cell spread of vaccinia virus. We confirmed and extended these results while discovering that retrograde trafficking was required for virus egress rather than entry. Retro-2, a specific retrograde trafficking inhibitor of protein toxins, potently prevented spread of vaccinia virus as well as monkeypox virus, a human pathogen. Electron and confocal microscopy studies revealed that Retro-2 prevented wrapping of virions with an additional double-membrane envelope that enables microtubular transport, exocytosis, and actin polymerization. The viral B5 and F13 protein components of this membrane, which are required for wrapping, normally colocalize in the trans-Golgi network. However, only B5 traffics through the secretory pathway, suggesting that F13 uses another route to the trans-Golgi network. The retrograde route was demonstrated by finding that F13 was largely confined to early endosomes and failed to colocalize with B5 in the presence of Retro-2. Thus, vaccinia virus makes novel use of the retrograde transport system for formation of the viral wrapping membrane. Importance: Efficient cell-to-cell spread of vaccinia virus and other orthopoxviruses depends on the wrapping of infectious particles with a double membrane that enables microtubular transport, exocytosis, and actin polymerization. Interference with wrapping or subsequent steps results in severe attenuation of the virus. Some previous studies had suggested that the wrapping membrane arises from the trans-Golgi network, whereas others suggested an origin from early endosomes. Some nonenveloped viruses use retrograde trafficking for entry into the cell. In contrast, we provided evidence that retrograde transport from early endosomes to the trans-Golgi network is required for the membrane-wrapping step in morphogenesis of vaccinia virus and egress from the cell. The potent in vitro inhibition of this step by the drug Retro-2 suggests that derivatives with enhanced pharmacological properties might serve as useful antipoxviral agents.	28	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.01114-16	Sivan G, Weisberg AS, Americo JL, Moss B.

This antibody-based lateral-flow assay labels and captures OPV viral agents to detect their presence. Serial dilutions of cultured Vaccinia virus (VACV) and Monkeypox virus (MPXV) were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the Tetracore assay by visual and quantitative determinations; specificity was assessed using a small but diverse set of diagnostically relevant blinded samples from viral lesions submitted for routine OPV diagnostic testing. The BioThreat® Alert assay reproducibly detected samples at concentrations of 10(7)pfu/ml for VACV and MPXV and positively identified samples containing 10(6)pfu/ml in 4 of 7 independent experiments. The assay correctly identified 9 of 11 OPV clinical samples and had only one false positive when testing 11 non-OPV samples. Results suggest applicability for use of the BioThreat® Alert assay as a rapid screening assay and point of care diagnosis for suspect human monkeypox cases.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.08.023	Townsend MB, MacNeil A, Reynolds MG, Hughes CM, Olson VA, Damon IK, Karem KL.

18852271	Pharmacodynamics of cidofovir for vaccinia virus infection in an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model system	Variola major virus remains a potent weapon of bioterror. There is currently an investigational-new-drug application for cidofovir for the therapy of variola major virus infections. Stittelaar and colleagues compared the levels of effectiveness of postexposure smallpox vaccination (Elstree-RIVM) and antiviral treatment with cidofovir or an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue 6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkoxy]-2,4-diaminopyrimidine (HPMPO-DAPy) after lethal intratracheal infection of cynomolgus monkeys with monkeypox virus, a variola virus surrogate. Their results demonstrated that either compound was more effective than vaccination with the Ellstree vaccine (K. J. Stittelaar et al., Nature 439:745-748, 2006). An unanswered question is how to translate this information into therapy for poxvirus infections in people. In a proof-of-principle study, we used a novel in vitro hollow-fiber infection model system to determine the pharmacodynamics of vaccinia virus infection of HeLa-S3 cells treated with cidofovir. Our results demonstrate that the currently licensed dose of cidofovir of 5 mg/kg of body weight weekly with probenecid (which ameliorates nephrotoxicity) is unlikely to provide protection for patients intentionally exposed to Variola major virus. We further demonstrate that the antiviral effect is independent of the schedule of drug administration. Exposures (area under the concentration-time curve) to cidofovir that will have a robust protective effect will require doses that are 5 to 10 times that currently administered to humans. Such doses may cause nephrotoxicity, and therefore, approaches that include probenecid administration as well as schedules of administration that will help ameliorate the uptake of cidofovir into renal tubular epithelial cells need to be considered when addressing such treatment for people.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.00708-08	McSharry JJ, Deziel MR, Zager K, Weng Q, Drusano GL.

17229505	Adjuvant-enhanced antibody responses to recombinant proteins correlates with protection of mice and monkeys to orthopoxvirus challenges	Recombinant proteins are being evaluated as smallpox and monkeypox vaccines because of their perceived safety compared to live vaccinia virus. Previously, we demonstrated that three or more injections of a Ribi-type adjuvant with a combination of three proteins from the outer membranes of intracellular (L1 protein) and extracellular (A33 and B5 proteins) forms of vaccinia virus protected mice against a lethal intranasal challenge with vaccinia virus. Here, we compared several adjuvants and found that QS-21 and to a lesser extent alum+CpG oligodeoxynucleotides accelerated and enhanced neutralizing antibody responses to a mixture of L1 and A33 proteins, provided the highest ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 isotype response, and protected mice against disease and death after only two immunizations 3 weeks apart. In addition, monkeys immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus proteins and QS-21 developed neutralizing antibody to monkeypox virus and had reduced virus load, skin lesions, and morbidity compared to the non-immunized group following monkeypox virus challenge.	34	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.12.037	Fogg CN, Americo JL, Lustig S, Huggins JW, Smith SK, Damon I, Resch W, Earl PL, Klinman DM, Moss B.

27637905	Protection of mice against the highly pathogenic VV IHD-J by DNA and fowlpox recombinant vaccines, administered by electroporation and intranasal routes, correlates with serum neutralizing activity	The control of smallpox was achieved using live vaccinia virus (VV) vaccine, which successfully eradicated the disease worldwide. As the variola virus no longer exists as a natural infection agent, mass vaccination was discontinued after 1980. However, emergence of smallpox outbreaks caused by accidental or deliberate release of variola virus has stimulated new research for second-generation vaccine development based on attenuated VV strains. Considering the closely related animal poxviruses that also arise as zoonoses, and the increasing number of unvaccinated or immunocompromised people, a safer and more effective vaccine is still required. With this aim, new vectors based on avian poxviruses that cannot replicate in mammals should improve the safety of conventional vaccines, and protect from zoonotic orthopoxvirus diseases, such as cowpox and monkeypox. In this study, DNA and fowlpox (FP) recombinants that expressed the VV L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R genes were generated (4DNAmix, 4FPmix, respectively) and tested in mice using novel administration routes. Mice were primed with 4DNAmix by electroporation, and boosted with 4FPmix applied intranasally. The lethal VVIHD-J strain was then administered by intranasal challenge. All of the mice receiving 4DNAmix followed by 4FPmix, and 20% of the mice immunized only with 4FPmix, were protected. The induction of specific humoral and cellular immune responses directly correlated with this protection. In particular, higher anti-A27 antibodies and IFNγ-producing T lymphocytes were measured in the blood and spleen of the protected mice, as compared to controls. VVIHD-J neutralizing antibodies in sera from the protected mice suggest that the prime/boost vaccination regimen with 4DNAmix plus 4FPmix may be an effective and safe mode to induce protection against smallpox and poxvirus zoonotic infections. The electroporation/intranasal administration routes contributed to effective immune responses and mouse survival.	2	Information Unavailable	Fowlpox virus; Intranasal mucosal vaccination; L1R, A27L, A33R, B5R VV genes; OPXV vaccine; Prime/boost; Recombinant vaccines	10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.09.002	Bissa M, Quaglino E, Zanotto C, Illiano E, Rolih V, Pacchioni S, Cavallo F, De Giuli Morghen C, Radaelli A.

Thymidine kinase preparations from eleven variola isolates and from five ""whitepox"" isolates were all found to be sensitive to inhibition by TTP. Preparations from other orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox, were all resistant to inhibition by TTP. There was no overlap between the two groups of results and no viruses were found which gave intermediate results. Tests with hybrid viruses showed that this character segregated independently of other biological marker characters and is thus a valuable additional marker for variola and variola-related viruses."	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Bedson HS.

15462204	[Bacterial and viral epidemics of zoonotic origin; the role of hunting and cutting up wild animals]	Since the Prehistoric times hunting has been a vital activity for man. However, this may account for the contamination of the hunter, his family and relatives. Infections may occur by direct contact with blood or tissues of infected animal during handling and cutting up preys and when preparing or eating meat, or also when bitten by injured animal. Apes and antelopes hunting in sub-Saharan Africa proves to be particularly important since it has been well established that the recent or previous emergence of some viral zoonosis (Ebola, Aids, T lymphotropic viruses and Monkeypox) resulted from hunting and poaching. Moreover predation among different species of non human primates such as that practised by chimpanzees against monkeys, has led to the construction of recombinant simian Lentiviruses, such as SIV cpz able to infect man and then spread over the entire mankind as it was the case with HIV-1.

8609491	DNA sequence variation as a clue to the phylogenesis of orthopoxviruses	We have sequenced DNA equivalent to the E5R ORF of Copenhagen vaccinia virus from an additional strain of vaccinia and from cowpox (three strains), camelpox (two strains), taterapox and ectromelia viruses. None of these showed the disruptions previously reported in the equivalent region of monkeypox virus. We also constructed a viable recombinant of vaccinia virus strain Dairen in which the E5R sequence was disrupted by a 436 bp deletion and substitution of the E. coli gpt gene. Quantitative analysis of the sequences, including available sequences from monkeypox, variola and vaccinia viruses revealed four main groupings, namely cowpox, ectromelia, monkeypox and a cluster which includes variola, camelpox, taterapox and vaccinia viruses. It was noted that, at over 75 % of the positions which differentiated species. all species but one had a common nucleotide. Although the analysis covers one single gene only, the results accord with what is known of the biology of the viruses.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-77-5-947	Douglas NJ, Dumbell KR.

20594906	Development of real-time PCR assay for specific detection of cowpox virus	Background: The number of recorded human cowpox cases are recently increasing. The symptoms caused by cowpox virus (CPXV) in a number of human cases are close to the symptoms characteristic of the orthopoxviral human infections caused by monkeypox or smallpox (variola) viruses. Any rapid and reliable real-time PCR method for distinguishing cowpox from smallpox and monkeypox is yet absent. Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a quick and reliable real-time TaqMan PCR assay for specific detection of cowpox virus and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this method. Study design: Based on aligned nucleotide sequences of orthopoxviruses, we found a virus-specific region in the CPXV genome and selected the oligonucleotide primers and hybridization probe within this region. The specificity of the developed method was tested using a panel of various orthopoxvirus (OPV) DNAs. The sensitivity was determined using the recombinant plasmid carrying a fragment of CPXV DNA and genomic DNA of the CPXV strain GRI-90. Results: The analytical specificity of this method was determined using DNAs of 17 strains of four OPV species pathogenic for humans and amounted to 100%. The method allows 6 copies of plasmid DNA and 20 copies of CPXV DNA in the reaction mixture to be detected. Conclusion: A quick and reliable TaqMan PCR assay providing for a highly sensitive and specific detection of CPXV DNA was developed.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jcv.2010.06.003	Gavrilova EV, Shcherbakov DN, Maksyutov RA, Shchelkunov SN.

19667083	Smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes (SPICE): dissecting functional sites and abrogating activity	Although smallpox was eradicated as a global illness more than 30 years ago, variola virus and other related pathogenic poxviruses, such as monkeypox, remain potential bioterrorist weapons or could re-emerge as natural infections. Poxviruses express virulence factors that down-modulate the host's immune system. We previously compared functional profiles of the poxviral complement inhibitors of smallpox, vaccinia, and monkeypox known as SPICE, VCP (or VICE), and MOPICE, respectively. SPICE was the most potent regulator of human complement and attached to cells via glycosaminoglycans. The major goals of the present study were to further characterize the complement regulatory and heparin binding sites of SPICE and to evaluate a mAb that abrogates its function. Using substitution mutagenesis, we established that (1) elimination of the three heparin binding sites severely decreases but does not eliminate glycosaminoglycan binding, (2) there is a hierarchy of activity for heparin binding among the three sites, and (3) complement regulatory sites overlap with each of the three heparin binding motifs. By creating chimeras with interchanges of SPICE and VCP residues, a combination of two SPICE amino acids (H77 plus K120) enhances VCP activity approximately 200-fold. Also, SPICE residue L131 is critical for both complement regulatory function and accounts for the electrophoretic differences between SPICE and VCP. An evolutionary history for these structure-function adaptations of SPICE is proposed. Finally, we identified and characterized a mAb that inhibits the complement regulatory activity of SPICE, MOPICE, and VCP and thus could be used as a therapeutic agent.	19	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4049/jimmunol.0901366	Liszewski MK, Leung MK, Hauhart R, Fang CJ, Bertram P, Atkinson JP.

541670	Structural polypeptides of Orthopoxvirus: their distribution in various members and location within the virion	The structural polypeptides of accepted species and recently isolated members of the genus Orthopoxvirus have been examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The viruses shared many polypeptides but some differences were found. The viruses could be divided into a vaccinia group (including buffalopox, 'Lenny' and MK-10), an ectromelia group (including elephant virus and Moscow virus), cowpox, camelpox and monkeypox. Minor differences were found in the polypeptides of monkeypox virus strains from human and monkey outbreaks. Controlled degradation of virions showed that the polypeptides which enabled the viruses to be differentiated were located in the surface and sub-surface layers. The cores of the viruses all gave the same complex polypeptide pattern.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-45-3-537	Turner A, Baxby D.

25128688	Co-administration of the broad-spectrum antiviral, brincidofovir (CMX001), with smallpox vaccine does not compromise vaccine protection in mice challenged with ectromelia virus	Natural orthopoxvirus outbreaks such as vaccinia, cowpox, cattlepox and buffalopox continue to cause morbidity in the human population. Monkeypox virus remains a significant agent of morbidity and mortality in Africa. Furthermore, monkeypox virus's broad host-range and expanding environs make it of particular concern as an emerging human pathogen. Monkeypox virus and variola virus (the etiological agent of smallpox) are both potential agents of bioterrorism. The first line response to orthopoxvirus disease is through vaccination with first-generation and second-generation vaccines, such as Dryvax and ACAM2000. Although these vaccines provide excellent protection, their widespread use is impeded by the high level of adverse events associated with vaccination using live, attenuated virus. It is possible that vaccines could be used in combination with antiviral drugs to reduce the incidence and severity of vaccine-associated adverse events, or as a preventive in individuals with uncertain exposure status or contraindication to vaccination. We have used the intranasal mousepox (ectromelia) model to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination with Dryvax or ACAM2000 in conjunction with treatment using the broad spectrum antiviral, brincidofovir (BCV, CMX001). We found that co-treatment with BCV reduced the severity of vaccination-associated lesion development. Although the immune response to vaccination was quantifiably attenuated, vaccination combined with BCV treatment did not alter the development of full protective immunity, even when administered two days following ectromelia challenge. Studies with a non-replicating vaccine, ACAM3000 (MVA), confirmed that BCV's mechanism of attenuating the immune response following vaccination with live virus was, as expected, by limiting viral replication and not through inhibition of the immune system. These studies suggest that, in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis, co-administration of BCV with vaccination should be considered a first response to a smallpox emergency in subjects of uncertain exposure status or as a means of reduction of the incidence and severity of vaccine-associated adverse events.	11	Information Unavailable	ACAM2000; ACAM3000; Cidofovir; Dryvax; MVA; Mousepox	10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.08.003	Parker S, Crump R, Foster S, Hartzler H, Hembrador E, Lanier ER, Painter G, Schriewer J, Trost LC, Buller RM.

201389	Poxvirus in West African nonhuman primates: serological survey results	Ten species of nonhuman primates in West African habitat were analysed for variolavaccinia subgroup haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and neutralization antibodies. The animals were taken in 27 different sampling zones in parts of the Ivory Coast, Mali, and Upper Volta. Of the 195 tested, 15 (8%) had elevated HI antibodies after nonspecific reactions were reduced with potassium periodate pretreatment. Positive neutralization antibodies were found in 21% (44 of 206). Antibodies were detected in serum from monkeys living near two areas where monkeypox cases in humans had occurred. Four samples were tested for monkeypox specific antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescent test; 3 were positive. Despite the prevalence of poxvirus antibodies in monkeys (and other animals) in West Africa, smallpox eradication has been maintained in the area since 1970; thus, animal reservoirs of poxvirus appear to pose no threat to the worldwide smallpox eradication programme.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Breman JG, Bernadou J, Nakano JH.

17402687	[Simian smallpox (or monkey smallpox): study of 8 cases observed at Impfondo Hospital in Republic of Congo]	Monkeypox or simian smallpox is a viral disease whose clinical manifestations are similar to the human smallpox. In this study authors describe the care management and follow up of eight patients hospitalized at the Impfondo hospital in Congo. It was a transversal study conducted from the 23rd of May till the 7th of July 2003 at the District Hospital of Impfondo (Likouala province, Republic of Congo). We have analyzed 81 patient files hospitalized during that period. Using the Atlanta CDC criteria of case definition modified in 2003, monkeypox has been diagnosed in 8 patients. Our series has 4 male and 4 female patients. The mean age is 9.05 +/- 5.86 with extremes ranging from 5 months to 18 years old. The clinical manifestations included fever (n = 7), rash (n=8), articulations and muscles pains (n=2), mumps (n=4) and pruritus (n=6). 7 patients recovered among them 5 without complications and 2 with persistent hypochromic lesions for more than 6 weeks. The monkeypox strain responsible for these infections appeared not to be lethal to humans. However this study shows that monkeypox is an endemic public health risk in the sanitary district of Impfondo, within the Congo River basin. The endemic presence of monkeypox in the Congo basin could trigger a new outbreak if the viral strains involved here became lethal.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Boumandouki P, Bileckot R, Ibara JR, Satounkazi C, Wassa Wassa D, Libama E, Moudzeo H, Bolanda JD, Ngokaba C.

22381921	Evaluation of disease and viral biomarkers as triggers for therapeutic intervention in respiratory mousepox - an animal model of smallpox	The human population is currently faced with the potential use of natural or recombinant variola and monkeypox viruses as biological weapons. Furthermore, the emergence of human monkeypox in Africa and its expanding environs poses a significant natural threat. Such occurrences would require therapeutic and prophylactic intervention with antivirals to minimize morbidity and mortality of exposed populations. Two orally-bioavailable antivirals are currently in clinical trials; namely CMX001, an ether-lipid analog of cidofovir with activity at the DNA replication stage and ST-246, a novel viral egress inhibitor. Both of these drugs have previously been evaluated in the ectromelia/mousepox system; however, the trigger for intervention was not linked to a disease biomarker or a specific marker of virus replication. In this study we used lethal, intranasal, ectromelia virus infections of C57BL/6 and hairless SKH1 mice to model human disease and evaluate exanthematous rash (rash) as an indicator to initiate antiviral treatment. We show that significant protection can be provided to C57BL/6 mice by CMX001 or ST-246 when therapy is initiated on day 6 post infection or earlier. We also show that significant protection can be provided to SKH1 mice treated with CMX001 at day 3 post infection or earlier, but this is four or more days before detection of rash (ST-246 not tested). Although in this model rash could not be used as a treatment trigger, viral DNA was detected in blood by day 4 post infection and in the oropharyngeal secretions (saliva) by day 2-3 post infection - thus providing robust and specific markers of virus replication for therapy initiation. These findings are discussed in the context of current respiratory challenge animal models in use for the evaluation of poxvirus antivirals.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.02.005	Parker S, Chen NG, Foster S, Hartzler H, Hembrador E, Hruby D, Jordan R, Lanier R, Painter G, Painter W, Sagartz JE, Schriewer J, Mark Buller R.

24841633	Simple technique for in field samples collection in the cases of skin rash illness and subsequent PCR detection of orthopoxviruses and varicella zoster virus	Background: In case of outbreak of rash illness in remote areas, clinically discriminating monkeypox (MPX) from severe form of chickenpox and from smallpox remains a concern for first responders. Objective: The goal of the study was therefore to use MPX and chickenpox outbreaks in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as a test case for establishing a rapid and specific diagnosis in affected remote areas. Methods: In 2008 and 2009, successive outbreaks of presumed MPX skin rash were reported in Bena Tshiadi, Yangala and Ndesha healthcare districts of the West Kasai province (DRC). Specimens consisting of liquid vesicle dried on filter papers or crusted scabs from healing patients were sampled by first responders. A field analytical facility was deployed nearby in order to carry out a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay using genus consensus primers, consensus orthopoxvirus (OPV) and smallpox-specific probes spanning over the 14 kD fusion protein encoding gene. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used on-site as backup method to confirm the presence of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in samples. To complete the differential diagnosis of skin rash, chickenpox was tested in parallel using a commercial qPCR assay. In a post-deployment step, a MPXV-specific pyrosequencing was carried out on all biotinylated amplicons generated on-site in order to confirm the on-site results. Results: Whereas MPXV proved to be the agent causing the rash illness outbreak in the Bena Tshiadi, VZV was the causative agent of the disease in Yangala and Ndesha districts. In addition, each on-site result was later confirmed by MPXV-specific pyrosequencing analysis without any discrepancy. Conclusion: This experience of rapid on-site dual use DNA-based differential diagnosis of rash illnesses demonstrates the potential of combining tests specifically identifying bioterrorism agents and agents causing natural outbreaks. This opens the way to rapid on-site DNA-based identification of a broad spectrum of causative agents in remote areas.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0096930	Dumont C, Irenge LM, Magazani EK, Garin D, Muyembe JJ, Bentahir M, Gala JL.

6278058	The surface antigens of orthopoxviruses detected by cross-neutralization tests on cross-absorbed antisera	Cross-neutralization tests were done on accepted species and recently isolated members of the genus Orthopoxvirus using antisera which had been separately absorbed with the various viruses. The results provided evidence for the involvement of four neutralizing antigens, and their distribution among 13 virus strains was determined. Monkeypox (Congo-8-Lombe), camelpox (Gorgan), ectromelia (Mill Hill), 'Lenny' and elephant poxviruses had distinctive antigenic formulae. Lister and Wyeth vaccines were indistinguishable but different from Copenhagen and EM63 vaccines which were themselves distinct. Cowpox (Brighton), buffalopox (BP4), MK 10, and Moscow poxviruses were indistinguishable. Examples were found where viruses shared surface antigens but were not all neutralized by antibody to them. this reduced the practical value of the technique for virus identification. Evidence was also obtained for the existence in some viruses of a fifth antigen, antibody to which could block neutralization by antibody to one particular antigen.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-58-2-251	Baxby D.

19833247	Molecular smallpox vaccine delivered by alphavirus replicons elicits protective immunity in mice and non-human primates	Naturally occurring smallpox was eradicated as a result of successful vaccination campaigns during the 1960s and 1970s. Because of its highly contagious nature and high mortality rate, smallpox has significant potential as a biological weapon. Unfortunately, the current vaccine for orthopoxviruses is contraindicated for large portions of the population. Thus, there is a need for new, safe, and effective orthopoxvirus vaccines. Alphavirus replicon vectors, derived from strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, are being used to develop alternatives to the current smallpox vaccine. Here, we demonstrated that virus-like replicon particles (VRPs) expressing the vaccinia virus A33R, B5R, A27L, and L1R genes elicited protective immunity in mice comparable to vaccination with live-vaccinia virus. Furthermore, cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with a combination of the four poxvirus VRPs (4pox-VRP) developed antibody responses to each antigen. These antibody responses were able to neutralize and inhibit the spread of both vaccinia virus and monkeypox virus. Macaques vaccinated with 4pox-VRP, flu HA VRP (negative control), or live-vaccinia virus (positive control) were challenged intravenously with 5 x 10(6)pfu of monkeypox virus 1 month after the second VRP vaccination. Four of the six negative control animals succumbed to monkeypox and the remaining two animals demonstrated either severe or grave disease. Importantly, all 10 macaques vaccinated with the 4pox-VRP vaccine survived without developing severe disease. These findings revealed that a single-boost VRP smallpox vaccine shows promise as a safe alternative to the currently licensed live-vaccinia virus smallpox vaccine.	30	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.09.133	Hooper JW, Ferro AM, Golden JW, Silvera P, Dudek J, Alterson K, Custer M, Rivers B, Morris J, Owens G, Smith JF, Kamrud KI.

4359680	Evaluation of virological laboratory methods for smallpox diagnosis	Between July 1966 and May 1972 the Vesicular Disease Laboratory, Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga., USA, tested specimens from 849 suspected smallpox cases by at least 2 methods, electron microscopy and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) cultures. A smaller number of specimens was tested by each of 4 methods: electron microscopy, CAM culture, agar gel precipitation, and tissue culture. For specimens handled in the field the CAM culture method was less sensitive than electron microscopy because the adverse conditions often inactivated the virus. CAM cultures were valuable for identifying members of the poxvirus subgroups, however, particularly when supplemented by tissue culture. The agar gel precipitation test was the least sensitive but was of value in confirming the results of electron microscopy. The latter was highly effective for the diagnosis of varicella, but dependably identified only about half of the vaccinia infections; for vaccinia, the CAM technique was essential. The occurrence of human monkeypox cases in West Africa emphasized that the usual smallpox diagnostic methods were inadequate. More sophisticated tests, such as the rabbit dermal sensitivity test, are necessary for accurate diagnosis of these cases as monkeypox.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Nakano JH.

25932665	Collection and Utilization of Animal Carcasses Associated with zoonotic Disease in Tshuapa District, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2012	The collection and consumption of animal carcasses is a common activity in forested areas of the Congo River basin and creates sustainability, conservation, and health concerns. Residents of the Tshuapa District reported collecting the remains of 5,878 animals from >30 species when surveyed about their wildlife consumption habits. Carcasses were discovered in varying degrees of decomposition and were often consumed at home or sold in local markets. The most commonly collected animals were Cricetomys gambianus (Northern giant pouched rat), Cercopithecus ascanius (red-tailed monkey), and Heliosciurus rufobrachium (red-legged sun squirrel). Many of the species recorded may be hosts of zoonotic pathogens, creating concern for spillover events.	8	Information Unavailable	Bushmeat; Ebola; carcass; monkeypox; primate; rodent; spillover	10.7589/2014-05-140	Monroe BP, Doty JB, Moses C, Ibata S, Reynolds M, Carroll D.

24050999	Systemically administered DNA and fowlpox recombinants expressing four vaccinia virus genes although immunogenic do not protect mice against the highly pathogenic IHD-J vaccinia strain	The first-generation smallpox vaccine was based on live vaccinia virus (VV) and it successfully eradicated the disease worldwide. Therefore, it was not administered any more after 1980, as smallpox no longer existed as a natural infection. However, emerging threats by terrorist organisations has prompted new programmes for second-generation vaccine development based on attenuated VV strains, which have been shown to cause rare but serious adverse events in immunocompromised patients. Considering the closely related animal poxviruses that might also be used as bioweapons, and the increasing number of unvaccinated young people and AIDS-affected immunocompromised subjects, a safer and more effective smallpox vaccine is still required. New avipoxvirus-based vectors should improve the safety of conventional vaccines, and protect from newly emerging zoonotic orthopoxvirus diseases and from the threat of deliberate release of variola or monkeypox virus in a bioterrorist attack. In this study, DNA and fowlpox recombinants expressing the L1R, A27L, A33R and B5R genes were constructed and evaluated in a pre-clinical trial in mouse, following six prime/boost immunisation regimens, to compare their immunogenicity and protective efficacy against a challenge with the lethal VV IHD-J strain. Although higher numbers of VV-specific IFNγ-producing T lymphocytes were observed in the protected mice, the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response and the presence of neutralising antibodies did not always correlate with protection. In spite of previous successful results in mice, rabbits and monkeys, where SIV/HIV transgenes were expressed by the fowlpox vector, the immune response elicited by these recombinants was low, and most of the mice were not protected.	4	Information Unavailable	Fowlpox virus; L1R, A27L, A33R and B5R VV genes; OPXV vaccine; Prime/boost; Recombinant vaccine	10.1016/j.virusres.2013.09.016	Bissa M, Pacchioni SM, Zanotto C, De Giuli Morghen C, Illiano E, Granucci F, Zanoni I, Broggi A, Radaelli A.

17515675	[Rapid differential diagnosis of Orthopoxviruses and Herpesviruses based upon multiplex real-time PCR]	Objective: Variola virus, belonging to Orthopoxviridae family, is one of the most dangerous human pathogens that could be used as biological weapon. We have developed a new rapid assay, based upon Real-time PCR and melting temperatures analysis of amplicons, for the contemporary detection of Orthopoxvirus, VZV and HSV1-2, that are the most important infectious agents to be considered for differential diagnosis. Methods: The target for detection of orthopoxvirus DNA has been a region of the crmB gene which is common to Variola virus and to other old world orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans. The targets for VZV and HSV1-2 have been ORF 29 and DNA polymerase, respectively. Suitability of the amplified fragments to RFLP or sequencing analysis, to recognize the involved viral species, has been also tested. Result: The selected primers have showed high sensitivity, specificity and compatibility with common amplification conditions. A mean melting temperature difference of 8.7 degree C was observed between the amplicons from the two virus types. Further identification of individual pathogens was made using RFLP analysis. Conclusion: The PCR-based protocol set up in this study for presumptive differential diagnosis of variola and herpesviral infections is rapid and specific and it can be used also to detect other orthopoxviral infections, like monkeypox.

20348530	A silent enzootic of an orthopoxvirus in Ghana, West Africa: evidence for multi-species involvement in the absence of widespread human disease	Human monkeypox has never been reported in Ghana, but rodents captured in forested areas of southern Ghana were the source of the monkeypox virus introduced into the United States in 2003. Subsequent to the outbreak in the United States, 204 animals were collected from two commercial trapping sites in Ghana. Animal tissues were examined for the presence of orthopoxvirus (OPXV) DNA using a real-time polymerase chain reaction, and sera were assayed for antibodies against OPXV. Animals from five genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, Funiscirus, and Heliosciurus) had antibodies against OPXV, and three genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, and Xerus) had evidence of OPXV DNA in tissues. Additionally, 172 persons living near the trapping sites were interviewed regarding risk factors for OPXV exposure, and their sera were analyzed. Fifty-three percent had IgG against OPXV; none had IgM. Our findings suggest that several species of forest-dwelling rodents from Ghana are susceptible to naturally occurring OPXV infection, and that persons living near forests may have low-level or indirect exposure to OPXV-infected animals, possibly resulting in sub-clinical infections.	36	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0716	Reynolds MG, Carroll DS, Olson VA, Hughes C, Galley J, Likos A, Montgomery JM, Suu-Ire R, Kwasi MO, Jeffrey Root J, Braden Z, Abel J, Clemmons C, Regnery R, Karem K, Damon IK.

20184745	Clinical experience, infection control practices and diagnostic algorithms for poxvirus infections - an Emerging Infections Network survey	Background: In order to determine how best to tailor outreach messages about poxvirus diagnosis and infection control for health practitioners, we surveyed infectious disease physicians in the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Emerging Infections Network. Findings: Surveys consisting of two unknown case scenarios designed to raise suspicion for monkeypox and orf were distributed to the 1,080 members of the EIN. The surveys contained questions pertaining to which diagnostic tests, points of contact, and transmission precautions they would likely utilize during patient evaluation. Basic response rates and frequencies of responses were calculated. Comparisons of the survey responses were made using the chi-square test. Of the 212 members who responded (20% response rate), significantly more respondents indicated that they would request diagnostic testing in the context of the monkeypox case scenario as compared to the orf case scenario. A significantly higher number of respondents indicated they would institute droplet or airborne precautions for the monkeypox case as opposed to the orf case scenario. Conclusions: This survey provided an opportunity for public health practitioners to gain insight into physician approaches to evaluation, diagnosis and reporting of suspected poxvirus-associated infections. This survey identified key areas in which public health practitioners can better serve physicians by focusing on education. As a result we were able to identify potential knowledge gaps and deficits in the availability of useful resources to facilitate accurate case identification and management.

4340220	Poxviruses isolated from clinically ill and asymptomatically infected monkeys and a chimpanzee	Poxviruses were isolated from the kidneys of an outwardly healthy chimpanzee trapped in an area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where a case of monkeypox had recently occurred in man, from the kidneys of clinically healthy cynomolgus monkeys in a colony in the Netherlands, and from monkeys suffering from monkeypox during outbreaks in colonies in the USA. It was established that two of the three viruses isolated from animals asymptomatically infected-namely, strain Chimp-9 from the chimpanzee and strain 64-7255 from the cynomolgus monkeys-although similar to one another differed markedly from the classical Copenhagen strain of monkeypox virus. These two viruses were characterized by the formation of small, monomorphic, well-defined pocks without haemorrhages on infected chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, by the small plaques of the proliferative type that they produced in cell cultures, by the absence of reactions when they were applied to scarified rabbit skin and the absence of marked necrosis when they were inoculated intradermally into rabbits, by their intensive replication in pig embryo kidney cell cultures, and by a number of other features. It is therefore possible to describe both the viruses as being very close to the variola virus. The Chimp-9 and 64-7255 strains differed from the variola virus only in their greater pathogenicity for white mice after intracerebral inoculation. The other virus isolated from a symptomless cynomolgus monkey-strain 64-9411-resembled the two viruses isolated from monkeys suffering from monkeypox and did not differ from the Copenhagen strain.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Marennikova SS, Seluhina EM, Mal'ceva NN, Ladnyj ID.

4308335	Trsmission of smallpox by contact and by aerosol routes in Macaca irus	Smallpox is believed not to occur naturally in species other than man. However, reports of several epizootics of an exanthematous disease, similar to smallpox, in wild monkeys have raised the question of a simian reservoir. If such a reservoir for smallpox exists, the eradication of this disease from the world would be a difficult or impossible task. Transmission of smallpox in Macaca irus has been studied to determine whether transmission occurs and if infection chains can be maintained by this species.Transmission was consistently accomplished by both contact and aerosol routes. In the contact transmission studies, the smallpox infection was maintained through 6 passages but was lost with the seventh passage. The virulence of the virus did not appear to increase as the virus was serially passed in monkeys. Continuing studies of the possible occurrence of smallpox and of monkeypox in simian populations are warranted.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Noble J Jr, Rich JA.

35664703	Lipid nanoparticle delivery of unmodified mRNAs encoding multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting poxviruses in rabbits	Poxviruses are a large and complex family of viruses with members such as monkeypox virus and variola virus. The possibility of an outbreak of monkeypox virus (or a related poxvirus) or the misuse of variola virus justifies the development of countermeasures. Furthermore, poxviruses can be a useful surrogate for developing technology involving antibody therapies. In our experiments, we explored the feasibility of utilizing unmodified mRNA that encodes three previously described monoclonal antibodies, c8A, c6C, and c7D11, as countermeasures to smallpox in a relatively large (>3 kg) laboratory animal (rabbits). We confirmed in vitro translation, secretion, and biological activity of mRNA constructs and identified target monoclonal antibody levels from a murine vaccinia virus model that provided a clinical benefit. Individually, we were able to detect c7D11, c8A, and c6C in the serum of rabbits within 1 day of an intramuscular jet injection of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA. Injection of a combination of three LNP-formulated mRNA constructs encoding the three different antibodies produced near equivalent serum levels compared with each individual construct administered alone. These data are among the first demonstrating the feasibility of launching multiple antibodies using mRNA constructs in a large, nonrodent species. Based on empirically derived target serum level and the observed decay rate, the antibody levels attained were unlikely to provide protection.

21372110	Glycosaminoglycans mediate retention of the poxvirus type I interferon binding protein at the cell surface to locally block interferon antiviral responses	Eradication of smallpox was accomplished 30 yr ago, but poxviral infections still represent a public health concern due to the potential release of variola virus or the emergence of zoonotic poxviruses, such as monkeypox virus. A critical determinant of poxvirus virulence is the inhibition of interferons (IFNs) by the virus-encoded type I IFN-binding protein (IFNα/βBP). This immunomodulatory protein is secreted and has the unique property of interacting with the cell surface in order to prevent IFN-mediated antiviral responses. However, the mechanism of its attachment to the cell surface remains unknown. Using surface plasmon resonance and cell-binding assays, we report that the IFNα/βBP from vaccinia virus, the smallpox vaccine, interacts with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Analysis of the contribution of different regions of the protein to cell surface binding demonstrated that clusters of basic residues in the first immunoglobulin domain mediate GAG interactions. Furthermore, mutation of the GAG-interaction motifs does not affect its IFN-binding and -blocking capacity. Functional conservation of GAG-binding sites is demonstrated for the IFNα/βBP from variola and monkeypox viruses, extending our understanding of immune modulation by the most virulent human poxviruses. These results are relevant for the design of improved vaccines and intervention strategies.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1096/fj.10-177188	Montanuy I, Alejo A, Alcami A.

11911586	Amplification of &#x27;variola virus-specific&#x27; sequences in German cowpox virus isolates	In 1995 a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol describing the specific detection of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, was published by Knight and others. Virulent variola major strains could be differentiated from less virulent variola minor strains because of the distinct amplicon sizes. Here, we applied this PCR protocol to DNA from various orthopoxvirus isolates. There was no amplification with the orthopoxvirus species vaccinia, monkeypox, mousepox, or camelpox viruses. However, amplification was observed in six out of 15 cowpox virus strains investigated. The size of the amplicons corresponded exactly with the size described for variola minor strains and the nucleotide sequence identity accounted for 97%. Findings are discussed with respect to the evolution of orthopoxvirus species assuming that variola virus most probably stems from a rodent-transmitted cowpox virus-like progenitor.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1046/j.1439-0450.2002.00532.x	Meyer H, Neubauer H, Pfeffer M.

This assay was found to be considerably more sensitive than the virus neutralization, haemagglutination inhibition, passive haemagglutination, and indirect fluorescent antibody tests for detecting antibodies, but has not yet been compared with radioimmunoassay.

195980	Preparation and evaluation of a noninfectious monkey pox virus vaccine	Monkey pox virus was mechanically disrupted by low temperature and high pressure into soluble and insoluble fractions. Soluble fractions elicited virus-neutralizing antibodies (1:20 to 1:160) in rabbits, whereas the insoluble (in saline) fractions did not (less than 1:5). No infectious virus was detected after the disruption procedure. Rhesus monkeys immunized with the soluble fraction elicited virus-neutralizing (1:1,200), complement-fixing (1:16), and hemagglutinating-inhibiting (1:80 to 1:160) antibody titers and were completely protected against monkey pox virus-induced disease. This model of monkey pox virus subunit vaccine preparation may prove to be useful in developing an efficacious noninfectious vaccinia vaccine for use in high-risk individuals.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/jcm.6.1.50-54.1977	Olsen RG, Blakeslee JR, Mathes L, Nakano JH.

14962998	Rapid detection and differentiation of human pathogenic orthopox viruses by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer real-time PCR assay	Background: The orthopox viruses that are pathogenic for humans include variola major virus (VAR), monkeypox virus (MPV), cowpox virus (CPV), and to a lesser extent, camelpox virus (CML) and vaccinia virus (VAC). PCR is a powerful tool to detect and differentiate orthopox viruses, and real-time PCR has the further advantages of rapid turnaround time, low risk of contamination, capability of strain differentiation, and use of multiplexed probes. Methods: We used real-time PCR with fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology to simultaneously detect and differentiate VAR, MPV, CPV/VAC, and CML. An internal control generated by cloning and mutating the PCR target gene facilitated monitoring of PCR inhibition in each individual test reaction. Results: Strain differentiation results showed little interassay variability (CV, 0.4-0.6%), and the test was 100-fold more sensitive than virus culture on Vero cells. Low copy numbers of DNA could be detected with > or =95% probability (235-849 genome copies/mL of plasma). Conclusions: The real-time PCR assay can detect and differentiate human pathogenic orthopox viruses. The use of an internal control qualifies the assay for high sample throughput, as is likely to be needed in situations of suspected acts of biological terrorism, e.g., use of VAR.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1373/clinchem.2003.026781	Panning M, Asper M, Kramme S, Schmitz H, Drosten C.

167685	Human and primate poxviruses: I. Growth characteristics of cytolytic and tumor variants	The dual potential of poxviruses to be cytolytic and tumorgenic has been extended. Yaba monkey tumor virus formed foci on monkey and human embryonic cells. Cytolytic or plaque-forming virus was isolated from Yaba tumor homogenates by selective sucrose centrifugation and passage through monkey or human embryonic cells. Monkey pox virus (MPV) was cytolytic for monkey cells or human embryonic cells, but upon passage onto young monolayers of human carcinoma cells, HeLa, produced a restricted cytopathic effect on first transfer, foci on second transfer and cytolysis after the fourth transfer. If HeLa monolayers were compact, the rapid growth precluded overt expression of cytolytic MPV. Electron micrographs of cytolytic Yaba indicated that Yaba development was similar to vaccinia and MPV but not totally organized. Growth curves of vaccinia, MPV and cytolytic Yaba were essentially identical in monkey and human embryonic cell lines.

10329580	Production and characterization of human monoclonal antibody Fab fragments to vaccinia virus from a phage-display combinatorial library	A combinatorial, phage-display library of human Fab antibody fragments was generated from IgG heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) genes cloned from the lymphocytes of a vaccinia virus (VACV)-immune donor. To ascertain the complexity of the library, nucleotide sequences of the variable regions of the HC and LC genes were determined. Fourteen distinct HC and 18 distinct LC (7 kappa and 11 lambda) that formed a combinatorial library of 22 Fabs were identified. Immune-precipitation of radiolabeled VACV revealed that at least six different VACV proteins were recognized by the antibodies. Plaque-reduction neutralization demonstrated that six of the Fabs neutralized VACV in the presence of anti-human antibody. ELISA studies indicated that 15 of the Fabs were cross-reactive with monkeypox virus.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1006/viro.1999.9701	Schmaljohn C, Cui Y, Kerby S, Pennock D, Spik K.

26664524	Pox-like lesions and haemorrhagic fever in two concurrent cases in the Central African Republic: case investigation and management in difficult circumstances	Cases of monkeypox in humans are frequently reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The few reports from the Central African Republic have been limited to cases in the far South closely bordering the Congos. Team members of an international medical organisation have suspected clinically two human cases of MPX, associated with clinical signs of coagulopathy and haemorrhage in the North of the country. Key findings were history of a squirrel, fever and vesicular dermal eruptions. Subsequently patients developed profuse epistaxis and hematemesis, associated with clinical signs of shock. Both patients were isolated and treated symptomatically. Samples were sent to a regional reference laboratory, who initially issued a confirmation of the suspected diagnosis of MPX in both cases. The result was later revised, and additional analyses of samples could not confirm the diagnosis.

11136755	Detection and differentiation of old world orthopoxviruses: restriction fragment length polymorphism of the crmB gene region	A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was developed to identify and differentiate Old World, African-Eurasian orthopoxviruses (OPV): variola, vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, ectromelia, and taterapox viruses. The test uses amplicons produced from virus genome DNA by PCR with a consensus primer pair designed from sequences determined for the cytokine response modifier B (crmB) gene of 43 different OPV strains of known taxonomic origin. The primer pair amplified a single specific product from each of the 115 OPV samples tested. Size-specific amplicons identified and differentiated ectromelia and vaccinia virus strains, which contain a truncated crmB gene, and enabled their differentiation from other OPV species. Restriction digests of amplified products allowed the identification and differentiation of variola, monkeypox, camelpox, vaccinia, and cowpox virus species and strains.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JCM.39.1.94-100.2001	Loparev VN, Massung RF, Esposito JJ, Meyer H.

6291794	Surveillance of orthopoxvirus infections, and associated research, in the period after smallpox eradication	"In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared the global eradication of smallpox and recommended the universal discontinuation of smallpox vaccination; nevertheless, it recommended that surveillance and research on orthopoxvirus infections should continue. By early 1982, all except 8 countries in the world had stopped routine vaccination programmes and all except 1 no longer required an international certificate of smallpox vaccination for travellers. Since 1978, as a result of continuing active surveillance, 176 smallpox rumours have been investigated in 60 countries. Two of these concerned the two laboratory-associated cases that occurred in the United Kingdom in 1978; all the others were false alarms. Special surveillance programmes for human monkeypox have been developed in West and Central Africa. The number of laboratories retaining variola virus stocks has been reduced to four. Investigations to determine the identity and origin of the six known isolates of ""whitepox"" virus have continued. Research on mapping of variola DNA and on monoclonal antibodies against certain orthopoxvirus antigens is continuing. All these measures are aimed at ensuring that the achievement of smallpox eradication is permanent."	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Arita I, Gromyko A.

2992830	[Monkey pox virus infection in humans in the Central African Republic]	A human monkeypox outbreak is reported which occurred in January 1984 in the extreme south-west areas of the Central African Republic. Six persons were found to be affected in a Pygmy camp with an estimated population of 50 residents. In the two affected families, out of 11 members, only unvaccinated children and a 22 year old unvaccinated woman contracted the disease. The disease was of moderate severity in two patients and very mild in the other four. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by virus isolation from skin lesions of 4 patients and by sero-immunologic tests in all of them. The clinically apparent monkeypox case reported in the Central African Republic in 1983, the presently described outbreak, as well as information on the disease obtained from Pygmies and missionary paramedical staff who are in frequent contact with them, suggest that monkeypox is enzootic in the tropical rain forest in the south-west areas of the Central African Republic.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Khodakevich L, Widy-Wirski R, Arita I, Marennikova SS, Nakano J, Meunier D.

Bacteriol. 83:837-843. 1962.-A comparison was made of the general growth curves of several poxviruses, variola, alastrim, vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, and monkeypox, on the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo. All curves showed a lag period, followed by a tenfold increase of infectivity each 5 hr for approximately 20 to 25 hr, a peak growth level at 48 to 52 hr (except monkeypox), and a gradual decline after 72 hr. Closer examination of the lag period revealed a rapid decline of virus infectivity within 2 to 4 hr after inoculation and the manifestation of an eclipse phase for 4 and 6 hr with all poxviruses. The lag period was terminated with the detection of intracellular virus at 8 to 12 hr, followed by the appearance of extracellular virus 2 to 6 hr later. The proportion of extracellular to intracellular virus was 0.1 or less throughout the different stages of poxvirus growth. In contrast to findings with the other poxviruses, however, extracellular virus equaled or exceeded the quantity of intracellular virus during the latter stages of the growth curves of variola and alastrim viruses.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/jb.83.4.837-843.1962	HAHON N, FRIEL JJ.

The corresponding genes were mapped and sequenced. Homologies of more than 95% were found when compared to the 14-kDa gene of vaccinia virus WR. However, point mutations which led to alterations in the amino acid sequences were mainly located between residues 26 and 40.

12620810	Four-gene-combination DNA vaccine protects mice against a lethal vaccinia virus challenge and elicits appropriate antibody responses in nonhuman primates	Two major infectious forms of vaccinia virus (VACV) have been described: the intracellular mature virion (IMV), and the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV). Due to their stability in the environment, IMVs play a predominant role in host-to-host transmission, whereas EEVs play an important role in dissemination within the host. In a previous report, we demonstrated that mice vaccinated with VACV L1R (IMV immunogen) and A33R (EEV immunogen) were protected from a lethal poxvirus challenge. Vaccination with a combination of both genes conferred greater protection than either gene alone, suggesting that an immune response against both IMV and EEV is advantageous. Here, we report that in mice individually administered DNA vaccines with two different VACV immunogens, A27L (IMV immunogen) or B5R (EEV immunogen), failed to significantly protect; however, vaccination with a combination of both genes conferred a high level of protection. Mice were completely protected when vaccinated with a combination of four VACV genes (A27L + A33R + L1R + B5R). Rhesus macaques vaccinated with this four-gene-combination developed appropriate antibody responses to each protein. Antibody responses elicited by this vaccine cross-reacted with monkeypox virus orthologous proteins. These data indicate that a gene-based vaccine comprised of the VACV A27L + A33R + L1R + B5R genes may be a useful candidate to protect against other orthopoxviruses, including those that cause monkeypox and smallpox.	81	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00038-7	Hooper JW, Custer DM, Thompson E.

8046400	Sequence alterations within and downstream of the A-type inclusion protein genes allow differentiation of Orthopoxvirus species by polymerase chain reaction	A PCR protocol was established that not only allows the detection of, but also the differentiation of species of the genus Orthopoxvirus. This assay was accomplished by the selection of oligonucleotides located within the gene that encodes the A-type inclusion protein of cowpox virus. The primer pair flanked a region exhibiting distinct and specific DNA deletions in the corresponding sequences of vaccinia, mousepox, monkeypox and camelpox virus. For this reason, PCR resulted in DNA fragments of different sizes. The presented PCR protocol, combined with BglII restriction digests, allowed the unequivocal assignment of 42 orthopoxvirus (OPV) strains and isolates to the correct OPV species. The resulting classification corresponded exactly with known biological data for the OPV strains investigated. Furthermore, 13 out of 22 cowpox virus isolates could be subtyped by the presence or absence of a small BglII fragment. DNA sequencing showed that the lack of this BglII fragment was caused by a deletion of 72 nucleotides.	21	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-75-8-1975	Meyer H, Pfeffer M, Rziha HJ.

As a positive control we used the antipoxvirus chemical preparation ST-246 available from SIGA Technologies Inc. (USA), synthesized in NIOCH SB RAS by the technique suggested by the authors. It was demonstrated that the compound NIOCH-14 (7-[N'-(4-Trifluoromethylbenzoil)-hydrazidecarbonil]-tricyclo[3.2.2.02,4]non-8-en-6-carbonic acid) possessed comparable with ST-246 antiviral activity concerning EV and MPXV on all indicators used. Therefore, at infection of mice with EV (strain K-1) and peroral administration of NIOCH-14 and ST-246 in a dose 50 mkg/g of mouse weight (12-14 g) within 10 days the survival rate and average life expectancy of mice authentically exceeded the control levels. EV titers in lungs through 6 days after infection in the same groups were lower than in the control. In addition to that, after 7 days of infection of mice with MPXV (strain V79-1-005) and daily peroral administration of NIOCH-14 and ST-246 in a dose 60 mkg/g of mouse weight (9-11 g) authentic decrease in a part of infected animals and MPXV titers in lungs was observed.

7123921	Smallpox: post-eradication vigilance continues	 PIP: This article summarizes the major findings and recommendations of the Committee on Orthopoxvirus Infections, established by the World Health Assembly to advise on posteradication policy. Although smallpox has been eradicated, there remains a need for the monitoring of vaccination practices, investigation of rumored smallpox cases, verification of virus and vaccine storage conditions, and surveillance of the other orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox. Routine vaccination for smallpox has been officially discontinued in 150 of the 158 Member States and Associate Members of the World Health Organization (WHO); Egypt and Kuwait continue to immunize, while the present status of vaccination remains unknown in 6 other countries. WHO is taking further steps to encourage all countries to cease this practice and is contracting laboratories that continue to produce smallpox vaccine to request that they cease commercial vaccine distribution. Since 1979, 124 rumors of smallpox cases from 55 countries have been investigated, most of which were misdiagnosed cases of chickenpox, measles, and other skin diseases; none has been smallpox. At present, variola virus is being stored in 4 laboratories, 3 of which are WHO collaborating centers. WHO will continue to inspect these laboratories to ensure that requirements for containment are being met. Programs for the surveillance of human monkeypox in west and central Africa are being initiated, although present data indicate that this disease is not of public health importance. The total number of known cases of human monkeypox since 1970 stands at 63. Important studies for the postsmallpox surveillance program include the development of simple and reliable screening tests for orthopoxvirus antibody and of reliable tests for antibody specific to monkeypoxvirus. Plans are underway to publish a book dealing with all aspects of the smallpox eradication campaign.

10901851	[Biohazards due to Orthopoxvirus: should we re-vaccinate against smallpox?]	Although the WHO declared global smallpox eradication in 1980, the Orthopoxvirus remains a source of concern for several reasons. Firstly, stocks of the smallpox virus have been preserved for experimental use (at least officially in the USA and Russia) so that an escaped isolate could lead to reemergence and spread of the disease worldwide. Secondly discontinuation of smallpox vaccination programs has led to dwindling acquired immunity in the world population thus raising the risk of epidemic extension of several Orthopoxvirus zoonoses (e.g., monkeypox). Thirdly stocks of camelpox virus which is very similar to Smallpox virus and was intended for biological warfare were discovered during the Gulf War in 1991 and pose a potentially serious threat. Finally official stocks of Smallpox virus could be stolen and used by bioterrorists. Thus reemergence of Orthopoxvirus including smallpox, monkeypox, cowpox, and camelpox is a real danger and contingency planning is needed to define prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or stop an epidemics. Adverse effects from earlier smallpox vaccine (vaccinia) in healthy people or immunocompromised people (congenital or acquired as in HIV infected patients) are absolute contraindications to smallpox vaccination at this time. Further research is needed to develop new vaccines (e.g., attenuated isolates of vaccinia) and effective treatment. This is the only valid reasons for postponing planned destruction of remaining Smallpox virus stocks.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Georges AJ, Georges-Courbot MC.

Growth of the virus in vitro and comparison with other poxviruses	A primate poxvirus (OrTeCa) isolated from a skin lesion in a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was studied along with four known poxviruses: vaccinia, monkeypox, swinepox, and Yaba. It grows in established lines of monkey kidney cells at a rate intermediate between that of vaccinia and monkeypox and that of swinepox and Yaba. The cytopathic effects produced by OrTeCa virus resemble those produced by swinepox virus, although, unlike swinepox, it cannot be propagated in porcine cells. Neither can OrTeCa be grown in rabbit kidney or chick embryo cells or on chick chorioallantoic membranes, all of which support the growth of vaccinia and monkeypox viruses. OrTeCa forms plaques about the same size as those of Yaba and swinepox viruses, but they appear earlier; they are morphologically similar to the plaques of vaccinia and monkeypox viruses. The thermal stability of OrTeCa is about the same as that of vaccinia and monkeypox but greater than that of Yaba virus.

18572748	Specific inhibition of orthopoxvirus replication by a small interfering RNA targeting the D5R gene	Background: Concerns about the potential use of smallpox in bioterrorism have stimulated interest in the development of novel antiviral treatments. Currently, there are no effective therapies against smallpox and new treatment strategies are greatly needed. Methods: In this study, specifically designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), targeting five proteins essential for orthopoxvirus replication, were investigated for their ability to inhibit vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (VACVWR) replication. Results: Among these siRNAs, 100 nM siD5R-2, an siRNA targeting the D5 protein, decreased VACVWR replication up to 90% when used either prophylactically or therapeutically in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. This siRNA induced a striking concentration-dependent inhibition of VACVWR replication and a prolonged prophylactic antiviral effect that lasted for 72 h, at a concentration of 100 nM. Confocal microscopy of Alexa-siD5R-2-treated VACVWR-infected cells confirmed a decrease in viral replication. Furthermore, siD5R-2 was shown to specifically reduce the D5R mRNA and protein expression using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blotting analysis, without inducing interferon-13 in A549 cells. We also demonstrated the antiviral potency of siD5R-2 against different pathogenic orthopoxviruses, such as cowpox and monkeypox viruses, which were inhibited up to 70% at the lowest concentration (1 nM) tested. Finally, siD5R-2 showed antiviral effects in VACVWR-infected human keratinocyte and fibroblast cell cultures. Conclusions: These results suggest that siD5R-2 could be a potential candidate to treat poxvirus infections.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Vigne S, Germi R, Duraffour S, Larrat S, Andrei G, Snoeck R, Garin D, Crance JM.

18605416	A poxvirus of primates. II. Immunology	OrTeCa poxvirus shares antigens with Yaba virus, as evidenced by two-way crossreactions in complement-fixation and neutralization tests. Antibodies produced by vaccinia and monkeypox viruses showed weak complement-fixation reactions with OrTeCa viral antigen, but neutralization reactions were negative and cross protection in vivo was not demonstrated. OrTeCa and Yaba virus antisera both contained complement-fixing and neutralizing antibodies against swinepox virus, but swinepox antiserum had no antibodies to any other poxvirus. Long-lasting immunity to the OrTeCa pox disease was produced in monkeys and man by spontaneous infection or vaccination with OrTeCa poxvirus. Complement-fixing antibody titers could be measured in convalescence, but tended to drop to low levels or disappear thereafter. In contrast, neutralizing antibody titers remained high for 3 years, and monkeys that were challenged with OrTeCa virus were reFractory to a second infection.

8345359	Characterization of the gene encoding the A-type inclusion protein of camelpox virus and sequence comparison with other orthopoxviruses	A gene was identified in camelpox virus strain CP-1 that is similar to the 160K gene of cowpox virus strain Brighton (BR) that encodes the A-type inclusion body protein (ATIP). The CP-1 gene was mapped, sequenced, and the presence of the ATIP-specific mRNA was demonstrated. The open reading frame [2178 nucleotides (nt)] was found at a similar position in the CP genome as the one reported for the cowpox virus 160K ATI gene. DNA sequence comparison revealed a deletion of two adjacent adenine residues relative to cowpox virus BR, generating a reading frame shift accompanied by the formation of a translational stop codon. An identical deletion has been described for vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve. The DNA sequence of the corresponding region of monkeypox virus strain Copenhagen revealed a deletion leading to a putative stop codon 75 nt upstream of the same stop codons in the camelpox and vaccinia virus genes. These findings are consistent with the expression of truncated ATIPs, of 94K in vaccinia and camelpox viruses and of 92K in monkeypox virus. In addition, a deletion of 789 bp could be localized downstream of the ATI open reading frame in camelpox virus isolates of different origin. This causes the transcription of a shortened ATI-specific mRNA (3.7 kb) relative to vaccinia and cowpox viruses (both 4.5 kb). The similarity observed in ATIP-encoding and flanking sequences might suggest that vaccinia and camelpox viruses are descended from a common ancestor.	11	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-74-8-1679	Meyer H, Rziha HJ.

2845688	[Human monkey pox: its clinico-epidemiological characteristics]	During the course of the smallpox eradication programme, a new eruptive disease clinically resembling smallpox was discovered in Zaire. The disease, which was named monkeypox after the virus, is a zoonosis occurring sporadically in countries of western and central Africa with tropical rain forest. The studies carried out in Zaire from 1980 through 1985 showed that monkeypox affects mainly children in relatively small remote villages whose population has traditionally frequent contacts with wild animals. Apart from the wildlife, the virus can be transmitted from man to man, but among other sources of infection sick persons did not exceed 20%. Presumed human transmission has occurred in 38 out of 61 outbreaks of human monkeypox and only once reached the third and once the fourth generation; the transmission in all affected villages under observation has extinguished itself. Considering the sporadic and relatively rare occurrence of the disease and expected complications following the immunization with vaccinia which protects from monkeypox, introduction of mass vaccination in the areas at risk is hardly justified at present.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Khodakevich LN, Szczeniowski MV.

225883	[Possible mechanism of orthopoxvirus preservation in nature]	Until recently, virus carrier state in the absence of overt clinical infection has been known for only one species of orthopoxviruses, namely, ectromelia virus. The paper describes the results of the modelling of asypmtomatic infection caused by monkeypox, cowpox, and ratpox viruses. Persistence of these viruses up to 6 weeks in animals (hamsters, cotton and white rats) with experimental asymptomatic infection as well as in apparently normal naturally infected white rats was established by isolation of virus from the organs of these animals. These results suggest that asymptomatic virus carrier state may occur both with ectromelia and a number of other orthopoxviruses. The mechanism may be of ecological importance, providing for circulation of these viruses and their preservation as biological species in nature.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Shelukhina EM, Shenkman LS, Rozina EE, Marennikova SS.

2552712	[Tenth anniversary of smallpox eradication: Results of epidemiological and virological surveillance and studies in the post-eradication period]	In accordance with recommendations of the Global Commission on the certification of smallpox eradication for the 10-year period after the eradication of this infection, all suspected cases of smallpox have been thoroughly checked up, and in none of them the diagnosis of smallpox has been confirmed. The study of monkeypox in humans has revealed that this zoonosis is spread over a wider area than supposed earlier and covers 7 countries of Equatorial Africa, occurring most frequently in Zaire. In about 70% of cases of monkeypox in human the disease is contracted from animals serving as natural virus carriers and in about one-third of such cases, from humans having monkeypox. The infectivity of humans with monkeypox for persons having close contacts with them is somewhat lower (12.3%) than in smallpox when this characteristic varies from 37% to 88%. Monkeypox in humans may take an asymptomatic course. Some species of tropical squirrels serve as natural virus carriers. These investigations have also resulted in essential corrections being made in understanding the ecology of cowpox virus, another orthopoxvirus pathogenic for man. At least 5 species of rodents have proved to be of interest as natural carriers of cowpox virus.

The identification of antibodies in 99 serum samples obtained in the Republic of Congo from children without vaccination scars was carried out by means of this assay. No antibodies to monkeypox virus were revealed. In 62% of cases the presence of antibodies was due to vaccinia virus. In the sera of 32% of children under examination antibodies differing from those to vaccinia and monkeypox viruses were revealed. To find out the origin of these antibodies, further seroepidemiological studies are necessary.	1	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Mal'tseva NN, Marennikova SS, Nakano J, Matsevich GR, Khabakhpashaeva NA.

Changes in our social environment, technological and ecological equilibrium have facilitated this phenomenon. Furthermore, certain of these viruses have demonstrated an almost unlimited capacity to adapt genetically to environmental change. HIV has already infected 40 million individuals, but monkeypox, Ebola, simian herpes can cause epidemics with serious if not fatal outcomes. Haemorrhagic fever epidemics have resulted from human contact with Flavivirus infected rodents and insects. Paramyxoviruses and morbiliviruses can cause fatal outcomes in man and animals. And the three influenza epidemics having occurred in the 20th century all came from the type A avian reservoir. The often complex combinations of predisposing factors having facilitated the emergence of several epidemics merit further consideration.

An enzyme labelled conjugate has been prepared from MoAb selectively reacting with monkey pox virus. This conjugate allowed the identification of monkey pox virus in the materials from patients. It also helped to determine that an orthopoxvirus isolated from wild squirrel in the Republic of Zaire was monkey pox virus.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Marennikova SS, Nagieva FG, Matsevich GR, Shelukhina EM, Khabakhpasheva AA, Platonova GM.

Postvaccination immunity was solid in all the animals vaccinated intradermally or orally. In 2 out of 14 monkeys immunized orally, however, the immunity was partially overcome. Neutralizing antibody titers in these two monkeys were 1:5 and 1:25, respectively. This agreed with the observations made in Pakistan indicating the possibility that some humans having serum neutralizing antibody titers up to 1:32 could contract smallpox and develop the disease.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Polozov AI, Sobolevskiĭ VI, Vorob'ev AA, Patrikeev GT, Zelenskiĭ LI.

6281571	Poxvirus infection in a colony of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)	An epizootic poxvirus infection occurred in a colony of 80 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) recently introduced to a laboratory facility. Over an 18-week period, 29 of the monkeys exhibited skin lesions that persisted for 4-6 weeks. Although eight marmosets died during the outbreak, their deaths were not attributed directly to the poxvirus infection. The skin lesions developed over the entire body surface including the soles and palms. Initially characterized as erythematous papules, they quickly changed to elevated coalescing lesions with extensive scab formation. Histopathologically, the lesions revealed moderate to marked acanthosis, and they progressed to full-thickness epidermal necrosis and ulceration. Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed occasionally within degenerate keratinocytes. These inclusions most probably constituted the intracytoplasmic aggregates of viral particles observed ultrastructurally and confirmed as members of the poxvirus group by negative staining of direct skin scrapings.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Gough AW, Barsoum NJ, Gracon SI, Mitchell L, Sturgess JM.

It is discussed whether orthopoxviruses of animals may then constitute a potential danger to man, with respect to their mutagenic and adaptation capabilities as well as their possible genetic interactions. Infection of man with these viruses is generally possible, but at present, not of acute importance. Monkeypox and cowpox viruses, as well as their variants occurring in carnivores and rodents, are of primary interest for individuals who have not been vaccinated against smallpox. Suggestions are put forward on how the human population, as well as domestic and laboratory animals, may be protected against infection with orthopoxviruses originating from animals. In particular, it is recommended that endangered groups of people should receive voluntary vaccination with genetically stable, attenuated vaccinia virus strains.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Mayr A.

The primary source of infection in both outbreaks was not established, the outbreaks were supposedly caused by sick wild animals. Almost all persons affected by this infection were children aged 7 months to 7 years, never vaccinated against smallpox; the only exception was a 29-year old female patient, formerly vaccinated and revaccinated against smallpox. During one of the outbreaks the laboratory-confirmed transmission of infection from man to man was established in two generations. During the other outbreak there were grounds to suspect the transmission of infection in three generations, though the possibility of contacting infection from animals could not be completely ruled out. The existence of the inapparent form of monkeypox in humans was revealed.	1	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Marennikova SS, Jezek Z, Szczeniowski M, Mbudi PM, Vernette M.

Four children in the same family were simultaneously attacked. In one of the two fatal cases, diagnosis of monkey-pox was confirmed by the isolation of the virus. In the three other cases, diagnosis was based on clinical and epidemiological findings. The coming out of monkey-pox in Gabon squares with sporadic coming out of this zoonosis observed in the humid tropical forests of west and Central Africa. Two fatal cases presented some symptoms of hemorrhagic fever and cutaneous symptoms did not dominate the clinical feature. As a consequence of it, monkey-pox has to be envisaged in similar cases. The attack of liver and spleen in man has not been documented up till now, as it has been for monkeys. Classical diagnosis is based on the isolation of the virus from a cutaneous lesion. In the present case, the virus was isolated from a blood sample. Epidemiological study did not reveal any interhuman transmission evidence, nor the source of infection.	6	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Meyer A, Esposito JJ, Gras F, Kolakowski T, Fatras M, Muller G.

6099936	The detection of subtle differences between different orthopoxvirus genomes by heteroduplex analysis	Corresponding DNA fragments from variola (Harvey) and monkeypox (Denmark) viruses which had been cloned into different plasmid vectors were subjected to heteroduplex analysis. Characteristic deletion loops corresponding to differences between the cloning vectors served as internal markers to identify and to orientate the heteroduplexed molecules. Partial denaturation of the resulting heteroduplexes was used as a primary screen to locate regions of heterogeneity between the poxvirus inserts. The denaturation threshold for homoduplexes was consistently higher than that for heteroduplexes. However, significant sequence divergence between corresponding fragments was indicated by larger than usual differences in thresholds between corresponding homo- and heteroduplexes. Denaturation bubbles of 0.1-0.5 kb were detected and hence small regions of heterogeneity between the genomes (180 kb) of variola and monkeypox viruses were localised. This procedure has a general application in comparative studies on large, complex but closely related DNA molecules.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0168-1702(84)90023-6	Kinchington D, Dollery A, Greenaway P, Dumbell K.

There are still countries where supervision is not satisfactory, there is uncertainty about animal reservoirs and it should be assumed from the beginning that up to the present no epidemic disease could be completely eradicated. For this reason it is inevitable that supplies of vaccine should be available. A vaccine from heat sensitive strains is offered which is obtained from cell cultures.

23207068	Cowpox virus but not Vaccinia virus induces secretion of CXCL1, IL-8 and IL-6 and chemotaxis of monocytes in vitro	Orthopoxviruses are large DNA viruses which can cause disease in numerous host species. Today, after eradication of Variola virus and the end of vaccination against smallpox, zoonotic Orthopoxvirus infections are emerging as potential threat to human health. The most common causes of zoonotic Orthopoxvirus infections are Cowpox virus in Europe, Monkeypox virus in Africa and Vaccinia virus in South America. Although all three viruses are genetically and antigenically closely related, the human diseases caused by each virus differ considerably. This observation may reflect different capabilities of these viruses to modulate the hosts' immune response. Therefore, we aimed at characterizing the specific cytokine response induced by Orthopoxvirus infection in vitro. We analysed the gene expression of nine human pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to infection of HeLa cells and could identify an upregulation of cytokine gene expression following Cowpox virus and Monkeypox virus infection but not following Vaccinia virus infection. This was verified by a strong induction of especially IL-6, IL-8 and CXCL1 secretion into the cell culture supernatant following Cowpox virus infection. We could further show that supernatants derived from Cowpox virus-infected cells exhibit an increased chemotactic activity towards monocytic and macrophage-like cells. On the one hand, increased cytokine secretion by Cowpox virus-infected cells and subsequent monocyte/macrophage recruitment may contribute to host defence and facilitate clearance of the infection. On the other hand, given the assumed important role of circulating macrophages in viral spread, this may also point towards a mechanism facilitating delivery of the virus to further tissues in vivo.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virusres.2012.11.013	Bourquain D, Nitsche A.

17240007	Smallpox DNA vaccine delivered by novel skin electroporation device protects mice against intranasal poxvirus challenge	Previously, we demonstrated that an experimental smallpox DNA vaccine comprised of four vaccinia virus genes (4pox) administered by gene gun elicited protective immunity in mice challenged with vaccinia virus, and in nonhuman primates challenged with monkeypox virus (Hooper JW, et al. Smallpox DNA vaccine protects nonhuman primates against lethal monkeypox. J Virol 2004;78:4433-43). Here, we report that this 4pox DNA vaccine can be efficiently delivered by a novel method involving skin electroporation using plasmid DNA-coated microneedle arrays. Mice vaccinated with the 4pox DNA vaccine mounted robust antibody responses against the four immunogens-of-interest, including neutralizing antibody titers that were greater than those elicited by the traditional live virus vaccine administered by scarification. Moreover, vaccinated mice were completely protected against a lethal (>10LD(50)) intranasal challenge with vaccinia virus strain IHD-J. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a protective immune response being elicited by microneedle-mediated skin electroporation.	63	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.11.017	Hooper JW, Golden JW, Ferro AM, King AD.

19024628	Progress in the discovery of compounds inhibiting orthopoxviruses in animal models	Surrogate animal models must be used for testing antiviral agents against variola (smallpox) virus infections. Once developed, these, compounds can be stockpiled for use in the event of a bioterrorist incident involving either variola or monkeypox virus, or used to treat an occasional serious orthopoxvirus infection, such as disseminated vaccinia complication following exposure to the live virus vaccine. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the discovery of novel antiviral agents found active against orthopoxviruses in vivo. This includes the development of new animal models or refinement of existing ones for compound efficacy testing. Current mouse models employ ectromelia, cowpox and vaccinia (WR and IHD strains) viruses with respiratory (lung) or tail lesion infections commonly studied. Rabbitpox and vaccinia (WR strain) viruses are available for rabbit infections. Monkeypox and variola viruses are used for infecting monkeys. This review describes these and other animal models, and covers compounds found active in vivo from 2003 to date. Cidofovir, known to be active against orthopox virus infections prior to 2003, has been studied extensively over recent years. New compounds showing promise are orally active inhibitors of orthopoxvirus infections that include ether lipid prodrugs of cidofovir and (S)-HPMPA, ST-246, N-methanocarbathymidine (N-MCT) and SRI 21950 (a 4'-thio derivative of iododeoxyuridine). Another compound with high activity but requiring parenteral administration is HPMPO-DAPy. Further development of these compounds is warranted.	17	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1177/095632020801900302	Smee DF.	Antivir Chem Chemother. 2008;19(3):115-24. doi: 10.1177/095632020801900302.
11292644	Vaccinia virus inhibitors as a paradigm for the chemotherapy of poxvirus infections	Poxviruses continue to pose a major threat to human health. Monkeypox is endemic in central Africa, and the discontinuation of the vaccination (with vaccinia virus) has rendered most humans vulnerable to variola virus, the etiologic agent of smallpox, should this virus be used in biological warfare or terrorism. However, a large variety of compounds have been described that are potent inhibitors of vaccinia virus replication and could be expected to be active against other poxviruses as well. These compounds could be grouped in different classes: (i) IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors (e.g., EICAR); (ii) SAH hydrolase inhibitors (e.g., 5'-noraristeromycin, 3-deazaneplanocin A, and various neplanocin A derivatives); (iii) OMP decarboxylase inhibitors (e.g., pyrazofurin) and CTP synthetase inhibitors (e.g., cyclopentenyl cytosine); (iv) thymidylate synthase inhibitors (e.g., 5-substituted 2'-deoxyuridines); (v) nucleoside analogues that are targeted at viral DNA synthesis (e.g., Ara-A); (vi) acyclic nucleoside phosphonates [e.g., (S)-HPMPA and (S)-HPMPC (cidofovir)]; and (vii) polyanionic substances (e.g., polyacrylic acid). All these compounds could be considered potential candidate drugs for the therapy and prophylaxis of poxvirus infections at large. Some of these compounds, in particular polyacrylic acid and cidofovir, were found to generate, on single-dose administration, a long-lasting protective efficacy against vaccinia virus infection in vivo. Cidofovir, which has been approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in immunocompromised patients, was also found to protect mice, again when given as a single dose, against a lethal aerosolized or intranasal cowpox virus challenge. In a biological warfare scenario, it would be advantageous to be able to use a single treatment for an individual exposed to an aerosolized poxvirus. Cidofovir thus holds great promise for treating human smallpox, monkeypox, and other poxvirus infections. Anecdotal experience points to the efficacy of cidofovir in the treatment of the poxvirus infections molluscum contagiosum and orf (ecthyma contagiosum) in immunosuppressed patients.	37	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1128/CMR.14.2.382-397.2001	De Clercq E.

18479761	Evaluation of orally delivered ST-246 as postexposure prophylactic and antiviral therapeutic in an aerosolized rabbitpox rabbit model	Orthopoxviruses, such as variola and monkeypox viruses, can cause severe disease in humans when delivered by the aerosol route, and thus represent significant threats to both military and civilian populations. Currently, there are no antiviral therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat smallpox or monkeypox infection. In this study, we showed that administration of the antiviral compound ST-246 to rabbits by oral gavage, once daily for 14 days beginning 1h postexposure (p.e.), resulted in 100% survival in a lethal aerosolized rabbitpox model used as a surrogate for smallpox. Furthermore, efficacy of delayed treatment with ST-246 was evaluated by beginning treatment on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 p.e. Although a limited number of rabbits showed less severe signs of the rabbitpox disease from the day 1 and day 2 p.e. treatment groups, their illness resolved very quickly, and the survival rates for these group of rabbits were 88% and 100%, respectively. But when the treatment was started on days 3 or 4 p.e., survival was 67% and 33%, respectively. This work suggests that ST-246 is a very potent antiviral compound against aerosolized rabbitpox in rabbits and should be investigated for further development for all orthopoxvirus diseases.	37	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.03.005	Nalca A, Hatkin JM, Garza NL, Nichols DK, Norris SW, Hruby DE, Jordan R.

19524427	The immunology of smallpox vaccines	In spite of the eradication of smallpox over 30 years ago; orthopox viruses such as smallpox and monkeypox remain serious public health threats both through the possibility of bioterrorism and the intentional release of smallpox and through natural outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as monkeypox. The eradication effort was largely made possible by the availability of an effective vaccine based on the immunologically cross-protective vaccinia virus. Although the concept of vaccination dates back to the late 1800s with Edward Jenner, it is only in the past decade that modern immunologic tools have been applied toward deciphering poxvirus immunity. Smallpox vaccines containing vaccinia virus elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses that confer cross-protective immunity against variola virus for decades after immunization. Recent studies have focused on: establishing the longevity of poxvirus-specific immunity, defining key immune epitopes targeted by T and B cells, developing subunit-based vaccines, and developing genotypic and phenotypic immune response profiles that predict either vaccine response or adverse events following immunization.	40	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.coi.2009.04.004	Kennedy RB, Ovsyannikova IG, Jacobson RM, Poland GA.

21265484	Acute vesiculopapular rash in the setting of atopic dermatitis	Atopic dermatitis is a common entity encountered in clinical practice. A subgroup within the atopic dermatitis cohort may develop viral infection on skin lesions appearing as a vesiculopapular pattern. This process is termed eczema herpeticum and may pose a challenge to the clinician as it can appear similar to orthopoxvirus infections, most notably smallpox and monkeypox. Because these conditions are considered as potential bioterrorism threats, confirmatory testing via histological examination, viral culture, immunohistochemical staining or PCR is recommended. Additionally, antiviral therapy should be promptly initiated as eczema herpeticum can disseminate or become superinfected with bacterial species. Early recognition and good communication with pathology can reduce morbidity and confirm the disease process.

17021562	New and re-emerging infectious diseases: epidemics in waiting	Purpose of review: New and emerging diseases, combined with the rapid spread of pathogens resistant to antibiotics and of disease-carrying insects resistant to insecticides, are daunting challenges to human health. Recent findings: The new diseases of recent months are West Nile virus conquering the American continent, the introduction of monkeypox in the USA, the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome worldwide, and avian influenza which crossed the species barrier again to claim several victims. Summary: Emerging infectious diseases are almost instantaneously a global concern because of the speed with which people, animals and products move around the world. In order to adapt to these new threats, there is a need for timely identification and reporting, the need to consider health problems from a global perspective, and the need to incorporate practising physicians in the process as much as possible.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1097/00001503-200406000-00012	Peleman RA.

15035027	Studying the global distribution of infectious diseases using GIS and RS	West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome and monkeypox are infectious diseases that have recently been introduced into areas far from their region of origin. The greatest risk of new diseases comes from zoonoses--pathogens that circulate among wild animals and are occasionally transferred to humans by intermediate invertebrate hosts or vectors that are sensitive to climatic conditions. Analytical tools that are based on geographical information systems and that can incorporate remotely sensed information about the environment offer the potential to define the limiting conditions for any disease in its native region for which there are at least some distribution data. The direction, intensity or likelihood of its spread to new regions could then be predicted, potentially allowing disease early-warning systems to be developed.	38	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1038/nrmicro776	Rogers DJ, Randolph SE.

19887033	Simian varicella virus in pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina): clinical, pathologic, and virologic features	Simian varicella virus (SVV; Cercopithecine herpesvirus 9) is a naturally occurring herpesvirus of nonhuman primates. Here we present the clinical, pathologic, and virologic findings from 2 cases of SVV in adult female pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The initial case presented with hyperthermia and a diffuse inguinal rash which spread centripetally, progressing to vesiculoulcerative dermatitis of the trunk, face, and extremities. At 96 h after presentation, the animal was anorexic and lethargic and had oral and glossal ulcerations. Euthanasia was elected in light of the macaque's failure to respond to clinical treatment. Seven days after the first case was identified, a second macaque presented with a vesicular rash and was euthanized. Gross necropsy lesions for both cases included vesicular, ulcerative dermatitis with mucocutaneous extension and hepatic necrosis; the initial case also demonstrated necrohemorrhagic gastroenterocolitis and multifocal splenic necrosis. Histology confirmed herpetic viral infection with abundant intranuclear inclusion bodies. Immunofluorescence assays detected antibodies specific for SVV. PCR assays of vesicular fluid, tissue, and blood confirmed SVV and excluded varicella-zoster virus (Human herpesvirus 3). Serology for Macacine herpesvirus 1 (formerly Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1), poxvirus (monkeypox), and rubella was negative. Banked serum samples confirmed SVV exposure and seroconversion. Investigation into the epidemiology of the seroconversion demonstrated a SVV colony prevalence of 20%. The described cases occurred in animals with reconstituted immune systems (after total-body irradiation) and demonstrate the clinical effects of infection with an endemic infectious agent in animals with a questionable immune status.	9	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Hukkanen RR, Gillen M, Grant R, Liggitt HD, Kiem HP, Kelley ST.

17331554	Murine alveolar macrophages limit replication of vaccinia virus	Because of concerns about zoonotic transmission of monkeypox to humans and the bioterrorism threat posed by orthopoxviruses, there is renewed interest in probing cellular and molecular mechanisms of host defense to these pathogens. In particular, it is essential to understand viral-host interactions in the respiratory tract, which is the route of infection for smallpox and a likely route of transmission for monkeypox. In this study, we analyze functions of alveolar macrophages in poxvirus infection, using a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing firefly luciferase to quantify infection in mice and cell culture. Depletion of alveolar macrophages with liposomal clodronate worsens the overall severity of infection in mice, including greater replication and systemic dissemination of vaccinia as determined by bioluminescence imaging. Absence of alveolar macrophages increases total numbers of granulocytes and granulocytes/monocyte progenitor cells in the lungs during vaccinia infection, indicating that protective effects of alveolar macrophages may be mediated in part by reducing the host inflammation. Alveolar macrophages also limit vaccinia infection in respiratory epithelium, as shown by a co-culture model of cell lines derived from alveolar macrophages and lung epithelium. Collectively, these data demonstrate that alveolar macrophages are key determinants of host defense against local and systemic infection with poxviruses.	21	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2007.01.033	Rivera R, Hutchens M, Luker KE, Sonstein J, Curtis JL, Luker GD.

21872779	One health: zoonoses in the exotic animal practice	Zoonoses make up approximately ¾ of today’s emerging infectious diseases; many of these zoonoses come from exotic pets and wildlife. Recent outbreaks in humans associated with nondomestic animals include Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola virus, salmonellosis, and monkeypox. Expanding human populations, increased exotic pet ownership and changes in climate may contribute to increased incidence of zoonoses. Education and preventive medicine practices can be applied by veterinarians and other health professionals to reduce the risk of contracting a zoonotic disease. The health of humans, animals, and the environment must be treated as a whole to prevent the transmission of zoonoses.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.cvex.2011.05.007	Souza MJ.

20143946	Uncovering the interplay between CD8, CD4 and antibody responses to complex pathogens	Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as the vaccine strain to eradicate smallpox. VACV is still administered to healthcare workers or researchers who are at risk of contracting the virus, and to military personnel. Thus, VACV represents a weapon against outbreaks, both natural (e.g., monkeypox) or man-made (bioterror). This virus is also used as a vector for experimental vaccine development (cancer/infectious disease). As a prototypic poxvirus, VACV is a model system for studying host-pathogen interactions. Until recently, little was known about the targets of host immune responses, which was likely owing to VACVs large genome (>200 open reading frames). However, the last few years have witnessed an explosion of data, and VACV has quickly become a useful model to study adaptive immune responses. This review summarizes and highlights key findings based on identification of VACV antigens targeted by the immune system (CD4, CD8 and antibodies) and the complex interplay between responses.	44	Review	Information Unavailable	10.2217/fmb.09.110	Moutaftsi M, Tscharke DC, Vaughan K, Koelle DM, Stern L, Calvo-Calle M, Ennis F, Terajima M, Sutter G, Crotty S, Drexler I, Franchini G, Yewdell JW, Head SR, Blum J, Peters B, Sette A.

26116113	The effect of volume of interest definition on quantification of lymph node immune response to a monkeypox virus infection assessed by (18)F-FDG-PET	Background: 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) is applied in the clinic for infection assessment and is under consideration for investigating the inflammatory/immune response in lymphoid tissue in animal models of viral infection. Assessing changes in (18)F-FDG uptake of lymph nodes (LNs), primary lymphoid tissues targeted during viral infection, requires suitable methods for image analysis. Similar to tumor evaluation, reliable quantitation of the LN function via multiple (18)F-FDG-PET sessions will depend how the volume of interest is defined. Volume of interest definition has a direct effect on statistical outcome. The current study objective is to compare for the first time agreement between conventional and modified VOI metrics to determine which method(s) provide(s) reproducible standardized uptake values (SUVs) for (18)F-FDG uptake in the LN of rhesus macaques. Methods: Multiple (18)F-FDG-PET images of LNs in macaques were acquired prior to and after monkeypox virus intravenous inoculation. We compared five image analysis approaches, SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVthreshold, modified SUVthreshold, and SUVfixed volume, to investigate the impact of these approaches on quantification of the changes in LN metabolic activity denoting the immune response during viral infection progression. Results: The lowest data repeatability was observed with SUVmax. The best correspondence was between SUVfixed volume and conventional and modified SUVthreshold. A statistically significant difference in the LN (18)F-FDG uptake between surviving and moribund animals was shown using modified SUVthreshold and SUVfixed volume (adjusted p = 0.0037 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: Quantification of the LN (18)F-FDG uptake is highly sensitive to the method applied for PET image analysis. SUVfixed volume and modified SUVthreshold demonstrate better reproducibility for SUV estimates than SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVthreshold. SUVfixed volume and modified SUVthreshold are capable of distinguishing between groups with different disease outcomes. Therefore, these methods are the preferred approaches for evaluating the LN function during viral infection by (18)F-FDG-PET. Validation of multiple approaches is necessary to choose a suitable method to monitor changes in LN metabolic activity during progression of viral infection.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/s13550-014-0049-z	Chefer S, Reba RC, Leyson CZ, Seidel J, Johnson RF, Blaney JE, Jahrling PB, Dyall J.

26060872	Poxvirus countermeasures during an emergency in the United States	Although smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980, national security experts remain concerned that it could be used in a deliberate attack. The United States and other governments have given priority to developing and stockpiling vaccines and antivirals to protect their populations from the potential reintroduction of this deadly disease. Public health officials are also concerned about the spread of related zoonotic orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox and cowpox, against which smallpox vaccine provides protection. This report analyzes how medical countermeasures available in the US Strategic National Stockpile will be given priority and used in the event of an intentional or accidental release of smallpox in the United States.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1017/dmp.2014.100	Bice S, Yeskey K.

6292349	The molecular biology of Yaba tumour pox virus: analysis of lipids, proteins and DNA	Cytopathological studies have shown that Yaba tumour pox virus (Yaba virus) infection leads to the accumulation of large lipid vacuoles. The rate of accumulation of these vacuoles increased as the infection proceeded. These lipid vacuoles were not seen in control cells or in cells infected with monkeypox virus (MPV) but were seen during Yaba virus infection in the presence of cytosine arabinofuranoside (100 microgram/ml). Yaba virus also failed to inhibit host protein synthesis as infection proceeded for prolonged periods. Yaba virus proteins were shown to be substantially different from those of MPV when analysed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The genome of Yaba virus gave restriction enzyme fragments which differed from those of the MPV genome when cleaved with the enzymes HindIII and XhoI. However, Yaba virus DNA hybridized to the HindIII fragments K, L and M and to the XhoI fragments A, B, C, E and G of MPV DNA.

19828265	Zoonotic poxviruses	Poxviruses compromise a group of long known important pathogens including some zoonotic members affecting lifestock animals and humans. While whole genome sequence analysis started to shed light into the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell infection, viral replication as well as virulence, our understanding of poxvirus maintenance in nature and their transmission to humans is still poor. During the last two decades, reports on emerging human monkeypox outbreaks in Africa and North America, the increasing number of cowpox virus infections in cats, exotic animals and humans and cases of vaccinia virus infections in humans in South America and India reminded us that - beside the eradicated smallpox virus - there are other poxviruses that can cause harm to men. We start to learn that the host range of some poxviruses is way broader than initially thought and that mainly rodents seem to function as virus reservoir. The following review is aiming to provide an up-to-date overview on the epidemiology of zoonotic poxviruses, emphasizing orthopoxviruses. By outlining the current knowledge of poxvirus transmission, we hope to raise the awareness about modes of acquisition of infections and their proper diagnosis.	108	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.026	Essbauer S, Pfeffer M, Meyer H.

Because human CPXV infection is rare, it is seldom suspected on clinical grounds only. We report a boy who presented with two necrotic ulcers with surrounding erythema. Infection with OPV was suspected, as antibiotic treatment had not produced improvement and smears were negative for anthrax. An OPV was isolated and an OPV-specific polymerase chain reaction combined with a subsequent restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism assay confirmed infection by CPXV. Although the patient's cat had had no skin lesions, OPV-specific antibodies were found at a titre of 1 : 8 in a plaque reduction assay, suggesting that the cat had transmitted the virus to the boy.	6	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1046/j.1365-2133.2001.04300.x	Schupp P, Pfeffer M, Meyer H, Burck G, Kölmel K, Neumann C.

15131152	Real-time PCR system for detection of orthopoxviruses and simultaneous identification of smallpox virus	A screening assay for real-time LightCycler (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) PCR identification of smallpox virus DNA was developed and compiled in a kit system under good manufacturing practice conditions with standardized reagents. In search of a sequence region unique to smallpox virus, the nucleotide sequence of the 14-kDa fusion protein gene of each of 14 variola virus isolates of the Russian World Health Organization smallpox virus repository was determined and compared to published sequences. PCR primers were designed to detect all Eurasian-African species of the genus ORTHOPOXVIRUS: A single nucleotide mismatch resulting in a unique amino acid substitution in smallpox virus was used to design a hybridization probe pair with a specific sensor probe that allows reliable differentiation of smallpox virus from other orthopoxviruses by melting-curve analysis. The applicability was demonstrated by successful amplification of 120 strains belonging to the orthopoxvirus species variola, vaccinia, camelpox, mousepox, cowpox, and monkeypox virus. The melting temperatures (T(m)s) determined for 46 strains of variola virus (T(m)s, 55.9 to 57.8 degrees C) differed significantly (P = 0.005) from those obtained for 11 strains of vaccinia virus (T(m)s, 61.7 to 62.7 degrees C), 15 strains of monkeypox virus (T(m)s, 61.9 to 62.2 degrees C), 40 strains of cowpox virus (T(m)s, 61.3 to 63.7 degrees C), 8 strains of mousepox virus (T(m), 61.9 degrees C), and 8 strains of camelpox virus (T(m)s, 64.0 to 65.0 degrees C). As most of the smallpox virus samples were derived from infected cell cultures and tissues, smallpox virus DNA could be detected in a background of human DNA. By applying probit regression analysis, the analytical sensitivity was determined to be 4 copies of smallpox virus target DNA per sample. The DNAs of several human herpesviruses as well as poxviruses other than orthopoxviruses were not detected by this method. The assay proved to be a reliable technique for the detection of orthopoxviruses, with the advantage that it can simultaneously identify variola virus.	39	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JCM.42.5.1940-1946.2004	Olson VA, Laue T, Laker MT, Babkin IV, Drosten C, Shchelkunov SN, Niedrig M, Damon IK, Meyer H.

19488021	Vaccinia virus infection &amp; temporal analysis of virus gene expression: part 1	The family Poxviridae consists of large double-stranded DNA containing viruses that replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Members of the orthopox genus include variola, the causative agent of human small pox, monkeypox, and vaccinia (VAC), the prototypic member of the virus family. Within the relatively large (approximately 200 kb) vaccinia genome, three classes of genes are encoded: early, intermediate, and late. While all three classes are transcribed by virally-encoded RNA polymerases, each class serves a different function in the life cycle of the virus. Poxviruses utilize multiple strategies for modulation of the host cellular environment during infection. In order to understand regulation of both host and virus gene expression, we have utilized genome-wide approaches to analyze transcript abundance from both virus and host cells. Here, we demonstrate time course infections of HeLa cells with Vaccinia virus and sampling RNA at several time points post-infection. Both host and viral total RNA is isolated and amplified for hybridization to microarrays for analysis of gene expression.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3791/1168	Yen J, Golan R, Rubins K.

28039021	Buccal viral DNA as a trigger for brincidofovir therapy in the mousepox model of smallpox	Orthopoxviruses continue to pose a significant threat to the population as potential agents of bioterrorism. An intentional release of natural or engineered variola virus (VARV) or monkeypox viruses would cause mortality and morbidity in the target population. To address this, antivirals have been developed and evaluated in animal models of smallpox and monkeypox. One such antiviral, brincidofovir (BCV, previously CMX001), has demonstrated high levels of efficacy against orthopoxviruses in animal models and is currently under clinical evaluation for prevention and treatment of diseases caused by cytomegaloviruses and adenoviruses. In this study we use the mousepox model of smallpox to evaluate the relationship between the magnitude of the infectious virus dose and an efficacious BCV therapy outcome when treatment is initiated concomitant with detection of ectromelia virus viral DNA (vDNA) in mouse buccal swabs. We found that vDNA could be detected in buccal swabs of some, but not all infected mice over a range of challenge doses by day 3 or 4 postexposure, when initiation of BCV treatment was efficacious, suggesting that detection of vDNA in buccal swabs could be used as a trigger to initiate BCV treatment of an entire potentially exposed population. However, buccal swabs of some mice did not become positive until 5 days postexposure, when initiation of BCV therapy failed to protect mice that received high doses of virus. And finally, the data suggest that the therapeutic window for efficacious BCV treatment decreases as the virus infectious dose increases. Extrapolating these findings to VARV, the data suggest that treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure and not rely on a diagnostic tool such as the measurement of vDNA in buccal cavity swabs; however, consideration should be given to the fact that the behavior/disease-course of VARV in humans is different from that of ectromelia virus in the mouse.	2	Information Unavailable	Antiviral; Brincidofovir; CMX001; Ectromelia; Variola virus; Viral DNA	10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.12.015	Crump R, Korom M, Buller RM, Parker S.

18666456	[Global threats from emerging viral diseases]	Emerging viral diseases are nothing new. Smallpox probably reached Europe from Asia in the 5th century, and yellow fever emerged in the Americas during the 16th century as a consequence of the African slave trade. Dengue fever arose simultaneously in South-East Asia, Africa, and North America during the 18th century. In 1918-1919 the so-called Spanish flu spread like wildfire through all five continents, killing between 25 and 40 million people. The second half of the 20th century saw the emergence of HIV/AIDS (1981), among other viral diseases. Even more worrying is the fact that emerging and re-emerging viral diseases have had a tendency to spread more quickly and more widely during the last decade, invading whole countries and continents; witness the recent outbreaks of Nipah virus, West Nile, Rift Valley fever, SARS, monkeypox, avian flu (H5N1) and Chikungunya. The complex factors underlying these new trends are briefly discussed.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/S0001-4079(19)32908-5	Chastel C.

11682123	Species-specific differences in the structure of orthopoxvirus complement-binding protein	Vaccinia virus complement-binding protein (VCP) is secreted from the cells infected with the virus and controls the complement activation reactions. This protein contains four short consensus repeats (SCR), typical of the protein family of complement activation regulators. Organization of the VCP genes/proteins of orthopoxviruses-monkeypox (MPV), variola, cowpox and vaccinia viruses-and their cellular homologues (DAF and C4BP) were studied comparatively. For this purpose, VCP genes of three MPV strains were sequenced. VCP gene sequences of other human-pathogenic orthopoxvirus species and strains determined earlier were involved in the analysis. It has been demonstrated that a premature termination of the MPV VCP open reading frame results in a truncated protein sequence carrying a deletion of the C-terminal SCR4. This is an essential distinction of MPV from other orthopoxvirus species.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00332-x	Uvarova EA, Shchelkunov SN.

1659066	Animal poxviruses transmitted from cat to man: current event with lethal end	"We report about the infection of an 18-year-old man with an orthopox virus (OPV) which was transmitted by a cat. The infectious route from cat to man could be proved by epidemiological, virological and serological methods. The corresponding techniques are described. The patient had not been vaccinated against smallpox and was intensively immunosuppressed by medication on account of a severe endogeneous eczema combined with an allergic asthma bronchiale. A cyclic poxvirus disease developed with a generalised, partly confluent pox virus exanthema disseminated over the body. The clinical symptoms were similar to a ""variola pustulosa haemorrhagica"". The young man died of a lung embolism in the course of the intensive medical therapy. The haemorrhagic character of the pox virus pustules with central necrosis (pox navel) could be reproduced in the rabbit skin and on chorioallantois membranes. The pox virus isolated from the patient could be differentiated from variola, vaccinia and monkeypox virus. It is a member of the group of ""cowpox-like viruses"". The environmental importance of these OPVs is discussed."	24	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.1439-0450.1991.tb00891.x	Czerny CP, Eis-Hübinger AM, Mayr A, Schneweis KE, Pfeiff B.

15644560	Demand for nonhuman primate resources in the age of biodefense	The demand for nonhuman primates will undoubtedly increase to meet biomedical needs in this current age of biodefense. The availability of funding has increased the research on select agents and has created a requirement to validate results in relevant primate models. This review provides a description of current and potential biological threats that are likely to require nonhuman primates for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Primates have been an invaluable resource in the dissection of viral disease pathogenesis as well as in testing vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccine approaches have been studied successfully for Ebola, Lassa, and anthrax in nonhuman primate models. Nonhuman primate research with monkeypox has provided insight into the role of cytokines in limiting disease severity. Biodefense research that has focused on select agents of bacterial origin has also benefited from nonhuman primate studies. Rhesus macaques have traditionally been the model of choice for anthrax research and have yielded successful findings in vaccine development. In plague research, African green monkeys have contributed to vaccine development. However, the disadvantages of current vaccines will undoubtedly require the generation of new vaccines, thus increasing the need for nonhuman primate research. Unfortunately, the current biosafety level (BSL)-3 and BSL-4 facilities equipped to perform this research are limited, which may ultimately impede progress in this era of biodefense.	20	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1093/ilar.46.1.15	Patterson JL, Carrion R Jr.	ILAR J. 2005;46(1):15-22. doi: 10.1093/ilar.46.1.15.
19644439	Laboratory-acquired vaccinia virus infection--Virginia, 2008	Vaccinia virus (VACV) is the live viral component of smallpox vaccine. Inadvertent exposure to VACV can result in infection, and severe complications can occur in persons with underlying risk factors (e.g., pregnancy, immunodeficiencies, or dermatologic conditions). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends smallpox vaccination for laboratory workers who handle nonhighly attenuated VACV strains or other orthopoxviruses (e.g., monkeypox, cowpox, or variola). On July 8, 2008, CDC was notified by a Virginia physician of a suspected case of inadvertent autoinoculation and VACV infection in an unvaccinated laboratory worker. This report describes the subsequent investigations conducted by the Virginia Department of Health and CDC to identify the source of infection and any cases of contact transmission. Of the patient's 102 possible contacts, seven had underlying risk factors for developing serious vaccinia infection. Investigators found no evidence of contact transmission and, based on the results of molecular typing, further concluded that the patient had been exposed to a VACV strain that had contaminated the seed stock from the laboratory where the patient worked. This case underscores the importance of adherence to ACIP vaccination recommendations for laboratory workers and use of safety precautions when working with nonhighly attenuated VACV.	6	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

17224068	From actually toxic to highly specific--novel drugs against poxviruses	The potential use of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, as a bioweapon and the endemic presence of monkeypox virus in Africa demonstrate the need for better therapies for orthopoxvirus infections. Chemotherapeutic approaches to control viral infections have been less successful than those targeting bacterial infections. While bacteria commonly reproduce themselves outside of cells and have metabolic functions against which antibiotics can be directed, viruses replicate in the host cells using the cells' metabolic pathways. This makes it very difficult to selectively target the virus without damaging the host. Therefore, the development of antiviral drugs against poxviruses has initially focused on unique properties of the viral replication cycle or of viral proteins that can be selectively targeted. However, recent advances in molecular biology have provided insights into host factors that represent novel drug targets. The latest anti-poxvirus drugs are kinase inhibitors, which were originally developed to treat cancer progression but in addition block egress of poxviruses from infected cells. This review will summarize the current understanding of anti-poxvirus drugs and will give an overview of the development of the latest second generation poxvirus drugs.	5	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-4-8	Sliva K, Schnierle B.

15114022	Mouse models for studying orthopoxvirus respiratory infections	Concern regarding the use of variola and monkeypox viruses as bioterrorist agents has led to an increased study of orthopoxviruses to understand the molecular and cellular basis of pathogenesis and develop safe and effective antivirals and vaccines against smallpox. Crucial to these efforts is the availability of animal models, which are inexpensive, genetically homogeneous, and recapitulate the human disease. The popular small-animal orthopoxvirus models employ the inbred mouse as the host, the respiratory tract as the site of virus inoculation, and orthopoxviruses-vaccinia, cowpox, and ectromelia viruses-as surrogates for variola virus. Ectromelia virus is likely the best surrogate for variola virus in a mouse model, as it is infectious at very low doses of virus, and the mousepox disease is associated with high mortality in the susceptible A, BALB/c, and DBA/2 stains of mice, but causes an unapparent infection in the C57BL/6 mouse strain. This chapter describes an ectromelia virus respiratory infection model in the mouse.	11	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1385/1-59259-789-0:289	Schriewer J, Buller RM, Owens G.

19365326	Vaccinia virus infection &amp; temporal analysis of virus gene expression: Part 3	The family Poxviridae consists of large double-stranded DNA containing viruses that replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Members of the orthopox genus include variola, the causative agent of human small pox, monkeypox, and vaccinia (VAC), the prototypic member of the virus family. Within the relatively large (approximately 200 kb) vaccinia genome, three classes of genes are encoded: early, intermediate, and late. While all three classes are transcribed by virally-encoded RNA polymerases, each class serves a different function in the life cycle of the virus. Poxviruses utilize multiple strategies for modulation of the host cellular environment during infection. In order to understand regulation of both host and virus gene expression, we have utilized genome-wide approaches to analyze transcript abundance from both virus and host cells. Here, we demonstrate time course infections of HeLa cells with Vaccinia virus and sampling RNA at several time points post-infection. Both host and viral total RNA is isolated and amplified for hybridization to microarrays for analysis of gene expression.

19031452	Detection of human orthopoxvirus infections and differentiation of smallpox virus with real-time PCR	We developed a real-time PCR protocol to detect orthopoxviruses (OPVs) from different clinical specimens and to separate variola virus from other OPVs. In our protocol, we used automated nucleic acid extraction system together with real-time PCR to create a simple, safe and fast procedure to obtain an initial result. The sensitivity was better by using designed hybridization probes as compared to SYBR green I for detection. The detection limit ranged from 13 to 1,300 copies per 20 microl reaction volume depending on the sample type. The PCR detected all OPVs pathogenic to human (variola, cowpox, monkeypox, vaccinia) as well as camelpox and ectromelia viruses. Amplification of variola virus sequences could be distinguished from other OPVs by melting curve analysis. We also demonstrated the applicability of the assay in human cases of cowpox and vaccinia virus infections.	8	Case Reports	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.21385	Putkuri N, Piiparinen H, Vaheri A, Vapalahti O.

11170953	Risks and prevention of nosocomial transmission of rare zoonotic diseases	Americans are increasingly exposed to exotic zoonotic diseases through travel, contact with exotic pets, occupational exposure, and leisure pursuits. Appropriate isolation precautions are required to prevent nosocomial transmission of rare zoonotic diseases for which person-to-person transmission has been documented. This minireview provides guidelines for the isolation of patients and management of staff exposed to the following infectious diseases with documented person-to-person transmission: Andes hantavirus disease, anthrax, B virus infection, hemorrhagic fevers (due to Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever viruses), monkeypox, plague, Q fever, and rabies. Several of these infections may also be encountered as bioterrorism hazards (i.e., anthrax, hemorrhagic fever viruses, plague, and Q fever). Adherence to recommended isolation precautions will allow for proper patient care while protecting the health care workers who provide care to patients with known or suspected zoonotic infections capable of nosocomial transmission.	19	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1086/318509	Weber DJ, Rutala WA.

7868651	A ligase chain reaction targeting two adjacent nucleotides allows the differentiation of cowpox virus from other Orthopoxvirus species	A ligase chain reaction (LCR) assay was developed to distinguish cowpox virus from other Orthopoxvirus species. The LCR targets two adjacent adenosine residues which are only present in the A-type inclusion protein gene (ATI-gene) of cowpox virus. Two primer pairs were designed with a one base pair overlap at the junction site and one primer of each pair was labeled radioactively. Detection of the ligation product was achieved after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Prior to LCR, the corresponding region of the ATI-gene was amplified by a consensus primer-directed polymerase chain reaction. All 18 cowpox virus isolates investigated could be clearly discriminated from 10 vaccinia virus strains, 5 camelpox virus isolates, as well as from mousepox and monkeypox virus reference strains. The LCR method allows a fast identification of cowpox virus isolates and is a feasible tool for the analysis of small mutations within viral genes.	2	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0166-0934(94)90150-3	Pfeffer M, Meyer H, Wiedmann M.

Properties of resulted recombinant proteins were studied with physical-chemical and immunological methods. It was shown with solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay that viral proteins inhibited hTNF binding with polyclonal hTNF-antibodies. The strongest inhibitor was VARV-CrmB, the less one was MPXV-CrmB. Biological activity of recombinant protein preparations was studied in the test of neutralization of TNF cytotoxicity for L929 murine fibroblast cells. It was shown that recombinant CrmBs neutralized cytotoxicity of hTNF, mTNF or rTNF in species-specific manner. It was shown also that effectiveness of hTNF cytotoxicity inhibition in vitro with VARV-CrmB exceeded the same effect of polyclonal hTNF-antibody. A possibility of the elaboration of new therapeutics for anti-TNF therapy on the base of CrmB-like proteins is discussed.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Gileva IP, Riazankin IA, Nepomniashchikh TS, Totmenin AV, Maksiutov ZA, Lebedev LR, Afinogenova GN, Pustoshiliva NM, Shchelkunov SN.

30485806	Identifying and Tracking Low-Frequency Virus-Specific TCR Clonotypes Using High-Throughput Sequencing	Tracking antigen-specific T cell responses over time within individuals is difficult because of lack of knowledge of antigen-specific TCR sequences, limitations in sample size, and assay sensitivities. We hypothesized that analyses of high-throughput sequencing of TCR clonotypes could provide functional readouts of individuals' immunological histories. Using high-throughput TCR sequencing, we develop a database of TCRβ sequences from large cohorts of mice before (naive) and after smallpox vaccination. We computationally identify 315 vaccine-associated TCR sequences (VATS) that are used to train a diagnostic classifier that distinguishes naive from vaccinated samples in mice up to 9 months post-vaccination with >99% accuracy. We determine that the VATS library contains virus-responsive TCRs by in vitro expansion assays and virus-specific tetramer sorting. These data outline a platform for advancing our capabilities to identify pathogen-specific TCR sequences, which can be used to identify and quantitate low-frequency pathogen-specific TCR sequences in circulation over time with exceptional sensitivity.	12	Information Unavailable	DNA sequencing; HLA-A2; T cell receptor; biomarkers; monkeypox; vaccinia	10.1016/j.celrep.2018.11.009	Wolf K, Hether T, Gilchuk P, Kumar A, Rajeh A, Schiebout C, Maybruck J, Buller RM, Ahn TH, Joyce S, DiPaolo RJ.

19738427	NFkB inhibitors: strategies from poxviruses	The orchestration of the inflammatory responses to both infection and tissue damage is arguably the key physiological function of NF-kappaB, and thus interference with the activation of NF-kappaB represents an exceptional strategy for a successful pathogen to exploit to counter multiple host innate defense processes through the targeting of a single host regulatory pathway. Because of their large genomes, which typically encode approximately 200 proteins, and their unusual independence from the host nuclear transcriptional machinery, poxviruses are especially well suited to manipulate the cytoplasmic activation of NF-kappaB. Indeed, poxviruses are known to encode multiple proteins that regulate the activation of NF-kappaB in a variety of different ways and these can be considered potential paradigms for the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapies and more effective vaccines. Given the renewed interest in the pathogenesis of orthopoxviruses like smallpox and monkeypox, we review the current understanding of how the various classes of poxviral immunomodulatory proteins target and manipulate the NF-kappaB pathway.	43	Review	Information Unavailable	10.4161/cc.8.19.9683	Mohamed MR, McFadden G.

12173463	[Orthopoxvirus genes for Kelch-like proteins. I. Analysis of species specific differences by gene structure and organization]	Genes and proteins of the kelch superfamily were structurally analyzed in the smallpox (SPV), monkeypox (MPV), cowpox (CPV), and vaccinia (VV) viruses. Genes potentially coding for the kelch-like proteins were found only in the variable terminal regions of the orthopoxvirus genome. The set and sizes of their protein products varied with species. All genes of the superfamily proved to be disrupted by mutations in SPV, which is highly pathogenic for its only host, man. The largest set of kelch-like proteins was observed for CPV, which is low-pathogenic for humans and has the broadest animal host range. The kelch-like proteins of one virus showed low homology to each other, whereas isologs of different viruses were highly homologous. The results testified to the earlier assumption that CPV is the most ancient and an ancestor of the other orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Totmenin AV, Kolosova IV, Shchelkunov SN.

12018707	Species-specific differences in organization of orthopoxvirus kelch-like proteins	Organization of orthopoxvirus proteins of the kelch superfamily and their genes were analyzed and compared. Complete genomic sequences of variola (VAR), monkeypox (MPV), vaccinia (VAC), and species-specific regions of cowpox (CPV) viruses were used in the work. Despite the multiplicity of kelch-like proteins in orthopoxviruses, their function is still vague. It has been discovered that the genes of orthopoxvirus kelch-like proteins are localized only to the terminal variable regions of the genome and display species-specific differences in the lengths of the proteins they potentially encode. All the genes belonging to kelch superfamily in the genome of VAR, which has the only host-the man, are mutationally destroyed. However, CPV, displaying the widest host range among orthopoxviruses, encode the most numerous set of kelch-like proteins. Weak homologies between kelch-like proteins of one virus were demonstrated as well as high homologies between isologues of different orthopoxvirus species. The comparison performed suggest that CPV virus is most ancient and may be considered as the ancestor of other orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1023/a:1014524717271	Shchelkunov S, Totmenin A, Kolosova I.

2114104	Quaternary structure of vaccinia virus thymidine kinase	Thymidine kinase enzymes isolated from a variety of sources are generally considered to have a native molecular weight of 80-90 kDa composed of two 40-45 kDa subunits. Although these parameters may accurately describe the atypical deoxypyrimidine kinases expressed by members of the Herpesviridae, the nucleotide sequences of thymidine kinase genes isolated from human, mouse, chicken and variety of poxviruses (vaccinia virus, monkeypox virus, variola virus, fowlpox virus and capripoxvirus) predict molecular weights on the order of 20-25 kDa for the derived primary translation products. To resolve this apparent dilemma, velocity sedimentation centrifugation, gel filtration chromatography and protein cross-linking procedures were employed to provide experimental evidence that enzymatically-active vaccinia virus thymidine kinase is a homotetrameric complex of 20 kDa monomers with a native Mr of 80 kDa.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0006-291x(90)92005-k	Black ME, Hruby DE.

11961260	Administration to mice of a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the intracellular mature virus form of vaccinia virus limits virus replication efficiently under prophylactic and therapeutic conditions	The WHO smallpox eradication program was concluded 21 years ago and the non-vaccinated population is now at risk of poxvirus infections, either by contact with monkeypox or through bioterrorism. Since drugs specific against poxvirus infections are limited, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are effective in vivo may be an important tool in controlling poxvirus infections. To this end, we studied the efficacy of the mAb C3, reactive against the trimeric 14-kDa protein of vaccinia virus (VV) localized in the membrane of the intracellular form of mature virus, for its ability to neutralize VV infection in mice. The results show that prophylactic as well as therapeutic administration of mAb C3 can be an effective means of control of VV replication within the host. The interval of antibody efficacy following a single administration, before and after VV inoculation, has been defined. This study reinforces the notion that neutralizing mAbs should be developed to control health-related human infections by poxviruses.	26	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-83-5-1059	Ramírez JC, Tapia E, Esteban M.

10868407	[Risk and risk management connected with xenograft]	Transmission of an animal virus to man is probably a constant reality. Pathogenicity is is not inevitable. Some vaccines were contaminated by cell culture but remain safe. Haemorrhagic fevers, despite limited outbreaks, are often cited in the media. On the other hand, the influenza A virus has been responsible for a large mortality. The cases of human infection with simian viruses (herpes virus B, cytomegalovirus, spumavirus, immunodeficiency virus) were accidental and have always remained asymptomatic. Monkeypox virus emerges in only some outbreaks. No transmission of animal endogenous retrovirus has been described. The precautionary principle, in the face of an unquantifiable risk, supposes that preventive measures should be taken in advance to reduce the risk at each step: isolation of the animal source after hysterotomy, transport in a germ-free environment, procurement and transplantation in rigorous surgical conditions, long-term follow-up surveillance of the patient, his or her family and healthcare workers. All the phases of the xenotransplantation procedure should be taken to limit the number of places and persons coming into contact with the recipient. Surveillance means regular clinical information. Various samples should be taken from the animal source, recipient, his or her family contacts, medical staff and cryogenically preserved as 'biological memory'. A National Xenotransplantation Register should be set up to gather and share all information on incidents.

24339772	An increasing danger of zoonotic orthopoxvirus infections	On May 8, 1980, the World Health Assembly at its 33(rd) session solemnly declared that the world and all its peoples had won freedom from smallpox and recommended ceasing the vaccination of the population against smallpox. Currently, a larger part of the world population has no immunity not only against smallpox but also against other zoonotic orthopoxvirus infections. Recently, recorded outbreaks of orthopoxvirus diseases not only of domestic animals but also of humans have become more frequent. All this indicates a new situation in the ecology and evolution of zoonotic orthopoxviruses. Analysis of state-of-the-art data on the phylogenetic relationships, ecology, and host range of orthopoxviruses--etiological agents of smallpox (variola virus, VARV), monkeypox (MPXV), cowpox (CPXV), vaccinia (VACV), and camelpox (CMLV)--as well as the patterns of their evolution suggests that a VARV-like virus could emerge in the course of natural evolution of modern zoonotic orthopoxviruses. Thus, there is an insistent need for organization of the international control over the outbreaks of zoonotic orthopoxvirus infections in various countries to provide a rapid response and prevent them from developing into epidemics.	76	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1003756	Shchelkunov SN.

12053717	Recognizing the real threat of biological terror	"Weapons of mass destruction can be used to harm and terrorize populations. Such weapons include those with chemical, nuclear or biological properties. Obviously computer viruses can add additional barriers to a quick response. The most effective, least costly and greatest threats are biologicals. Biological terror is not new, and biological weapons have been used for centuries. However, as a result of modern technology, the risks are greater now and the outcomes more terrible. Today they include live pathogens, various toxins, and theoretically ""bioregulators""--biochemicals affecting cell signaling. Altered cell signaling could be used to induce apoptosis-cell death, or a heightened outpouring of cytokines mimicking overwhelming sepsis, or even an intracellular, biochemical ""strike"" causing cellular paralysis. Biological weaponeers now have the frightening ability to alter the genetic makeup of pathogens, rendering them resistant not only to available antibiotic therapy but also to currently effective vaccines. In dark corners of some fringe groups, bioweaponeers are searching for the capability of designing pathogens that target specific races, by virtue of discriminating ligands (1). The resulting morbidity and mortality from use of any biological weapons will be accompanied by chaos, governmental and social instability, panic, an extraordinary utilization of available resources, and an ongoing epidemic of sleepless nights (2,3). Herein I will review some of the issues and some of the currently available biological weapons.

Currently, there is a need to develop safe and effective inhibitors for poxvirus-induced diseases such as smallpox caused by variola, which is a potential biological warfare agent. Likewise emerging zoonotic infections due to cowpox virus and monkeypox virus require the development of effective countermeasures. Tecovirimat, also known as ST-246, has shown efficacy in all small animal and nonhuman primate prophylaxis and therapeutic efficacy models of poxvirus-induced disease tested to date. Phase I clinical trials and new drug application-enabling toxicology studies have been completed with tecovirimat. A phase II clinical study is being run and SIGA has initiated commercial scale-up manufacturing and preparation for the pivotal safety and efficacy studies. SIGA is committed to getting approval for tecovirimat and supplying it to the Strategic National Stockpile, the Department of Defense and global health authorities.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1358/dot.2010.46.2.1437244	Bolken TC, Hruby DE.

21470451	Orthopoxvirus DNA in Eurasian lynx, Sweden	Cowpox virus, which has been used to protect humans against smallpox but may cause severe disease in immunocompromised persons, has reemerged in humans, domestic cats, and other animal species in Europe. Orthopoxvirus (OPV) DNA was detected in tissues (lung, kidney, spleen) in 24 (9%) of 263 free-ranging Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from Sweden. Thymidine kinase gene amplicon sequences (339 bp) from 21 lynx were all identical to those from cowpox virus isolated from a person in Norway and phylogenetically closer to monkeypox virus than to vaccinia virus and isolates from 2 persons with cowpox virus in Sweden. Prevalence was higher among animals from regions with dense, rather than rural, human populations. Lynx are probably exposed to OPV through predation on small mammal reservoir species. We conclude that OPV is widely distributed in Sweden and may represent a threat to humans. Further studies are needed to verify whether this lynx OPV is cowpox virus.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1704.091899	Tryland M, Okeke MI, Af Segerstad CH, Mörner T, Traavik T, Ryser-Degiorgis MP.

20703935	Interaction of orthopoxviruses with the cellular ubiquitin-ligase system	Protein modification by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like polypeptides is important for the fate and functions of the majority of proteins in the eukaryotic cell and can be involved in regulation of various biological processes, including protein metabolism (degradation), protein transport to several cellular compartments, rearrangement of cytoskeleton, and transcription of cytoprotective genes. The accumulated experimental data suggest that the ankyrin-F-box-like and BTB-kelch-like proteins of orthopoxviruses, represented by the largest viral multigene families, interact with the cellular Cullin-1- and Cullin-3-containing ubiquitin-protein ligases, respectively. In addition, orthopoxviruses code for their own RING-domain-containing ubiquitin ligase. In this review, this author discusses the differences between variola (smallpox), monkeypox, cowpox, vaccinia, and ectromelia (mousepox) viruses in the organization of ankyrin-F-box and BTB-kelch protein families and their likely functions.	13	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1007/s11262-010-0519-y	Shchelkunov SN.

19738346	When good vaccines go wild: Feral Orthopoxvirus in developing countries and beyond	The presence of zoonotic poxviruses in nature represents a potential human health risk that has to be re-evaluated by health authorities not only in developing countries, but also in many developed countries. For example, buffalopox virus infection remains to be a threat to humans and cattle in India, and monkeypox virus infection persists in several inhabited places in Africa and, more recently, in the USA. There are also a great number of zoonotic transmissions of cowpox virus from cats to humans in Europe. For almost a decade in Brazil, vaccinia-like viruses have been isolated from human and cattle infections. This review examines the ability of potentially pathogenic orthopoxviruses, including feral versions of vaccinia virus vaccine, to persist in nature and re-emerge for reasons we do not yet understand.	25	Review	Information Unavailable	10.3855/jidc.258	Moussatché N, Damaso CR, McFadden G.

17254642	Orthopoxvirus pan-genomic DNA assay	A genome-spanning assay is described that enables laboratory confirmation of infections with orthopoxviruses (OPVs), particularly Vaccinia, Monkeypox, and Variola viruses, which can cause vesiculo-pustular rash illnesses in humans. The assay uses a series of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons that overlap to span the approximately 200kilobase pair linear DNA genome of OPVs. Corresponding amplicons of different viral isolates can then be compared by matching their restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) gel electrophoresis patterns. The PCR step does not necessarily require viral growth to produce sufficient DNA for the RFLP comparisons. The assay would be useful as a prelude to sequencing entire or partial DNA genome regions of various OPVs, including natural or recombinant OPVs and potentially dangerous bioengineered OPVs designed to express foreign DNA or other viruses.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jviromet.2006.12.005	Li Y, Ropp SL, Zhao H, Damon IK, Esposito JJ.

2816178	Establishment of an ELISA for the detection of orthopox viruses based on neutralizing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies	Various combinations of polyclonal and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of distinct specificity were evaluated as capture or detecting antibodies in an orthopox virus antigen ELISA. Acceptable results were achieved in an assay based on polyclonal antibodies. A 10 times higher sensitivity, however, was obtained using a combination of one monoclonal catching antibody reactive with viral envelope epitopes and polyclonal detection antibodies. This configuration proved to be superior in sensitivity to all others. Specificity was confirmed with 5 vaccinia virus strains (including one recombinant virus) and 8 species of orthopox viruses. Monkeypox and mousepox virus reacted exclusively in the polyclonal assay due to a lack of the specific epitope for the monoclonal antibody. The detection limit compared to the infectivity titer amounted to 10(3)-10(4) in the monoclonal/polyclonal and to 10(4)-10(5) TCID50/0.1 ml in the polyclonal combination. The correlation between infectivity- and ELISA-titer was demonstrated by a study of the replication cycle of the rabbitpox virus Uetrecht in the permanent rabbit kidney cell line RK-13. With the established ELISAs vaccinia virus could also be detected in organ suspensions of lethally infected NMRI-mice, depending on the level of infectivity.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.1439-0450.1989.tb00641.x	Czerny CP, Meyer H, Mahnel H.

19363464	Vaccinia virus infection &amp; temporal analysis of virus gene expression: Part 2	The family Poxviridae consists of large double-stranded DNA containing viruses that replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Members of the orthopox genus include variola, the causative agent of human small pox, monkeypox, and vaccinia (VAC), the prototypic member of the virus family. Within the relatively large (approximately 200 kb) vaccinia genome, three classes of genes are encoded: early, intermediate, and late. While all three classes are transcribed by virally-encoded RNA polymerases, each class serves a different function in the life cycle of the virus. Poxviruses utilize multiple strategies for modulation of the host cellular environment during infection. In order to understand regulation of both host and virus gene expression, we have utilized genome-wide approaches to analyze transcript abundance from both virus and host cells. Here, we demonstrate time course infections of HeLa cells with Vaccinia virus and sampling RNA at several time points post-infection. Both host and viral total RNA is isolated and amplified for hybridization to microarrays for analysis of gene expression.

15043137	L-deaza-5&#x27;-noraisteromycin	(+/-)-1-Deazaaristeromycin (4) has been reported to be an inactivator of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase and, as a consequence, to affect S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) mediated macromolecular biomethylations. To extend this to our program focused on 5'-noraristeromycin derivatives as inhibitors of the same hydrolase enzyme as potential antiviral agents, both enantiomers of 1-deaza-5'-noraristeromycin (5 and 20) have been prepared. Compounds 5 and 20 were evaluated against the following viruses: vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, Ebola, herpes simplex type 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr, varicella zoster, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV-1 and HIV-2, adenovirus type 1, measles, Pichinde, parainfluenza type 3, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), influenza B, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, rhinovirus type 2, respiratory syncytial, yellow fever, and West Nile.

14668863	The role of evolution in the emergence of infectious diseases	It is unclear when, where and how novel pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), monkeypox and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will cross the barriers that separate their natural reservoirs from human populations and ignite the epidemic spread of novel infectious diseases. New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population and to generate subsequent human-to-human transmission. Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R(0), should exceed one, where R(0) is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population. However, an increase in R(0), even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R(0) > 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.	220	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/nature02104	Antia R, Regoes RR, Koella JC, Bergstrom CT.

9160329	The potential of 5&#x27; nuclease PCR for detecting a single-base polymorphism in Orthopoxvirus	A fluorogenic 5' nuclease PCR assay was evaluated for its ability to specifically detect and differentiate DNA of two Orthopoxvirus species. A pair of consensus primers that target a DNA segment of the Orthopoxvirus haemagglutinin gene, and two oligonucleotide probes; each labelled with a different fluorescent reporter dye and the same quencher dye, were used in a single-tube assay. The assay is based on the 5'-->3' nuclease activity of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase that cleaves a fluorescein-labelled hybridized probe. Probe cleavage generates specific fluorescent signals whose intensity can be quantified by fluorometry. After evaluating the effects of various annealing temperatures and probe concentrations and normalizing the emission intensities of the reporter dyes, it was possible to detect and differentiate monkeypox and vaccinia virus DNAs on the basis of a single-base polymorphism. The sensitivity of the 5' nuclease PCR assay is comparable to the sensitivity of ethidium bromide-stained gels, but the assay provides higher specificity and virtually eliminates the need for laborious post-PCR processing.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1006/mcpr.1996.0093	Ibrahim MS, Esposito JJ, Jahrling PB, Lofts RS.

30918078	Identification of CP77 as the Third Orthopoxvirus SAMD9 and SAMD9L Inhibitor with Unique Specificity for a Rodent SAMD9L	Orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) have a broad host range in mammalian cells, but Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are nonpermissive for vaccinia virus (VACV). Here, we revealed a species-specific difference in host restriction factor SAMD9L as the cause for the restriction and identified orthopoxvirus CP77 as a unique inhibitor capable of antagonizing Chinese hamster SAMD9L (chSAMD9L). Two known VACV inhibitors of SAMD9 and SAMD9L (SAMD9&L), K1 and C7, can bind human and mouse SAMD9&L, but neither can bind chSAMD9L. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 knockout of chSAMD9L from CHO cells removed the restriction for VACV, while ectopic expression of chSAMD9L imposed the restriction for VACV in a human cell line, demonstrating that chSAMD9L is a potent restriction factor for VACV. In contrast to K1 and C7, cowpox virus CP77 can bind chSAMD9L and rescue VACV replication in cells expressing chSAMD9L, indicating that CP77 is yet another SAMD9L inhibitor but has a unique specificity for chSAMD9L. Binding studies showed that the N-terminal 382 amino acids of CP77 were sufficient for binding chSAMD9L and that both K1 and CP77 target a common internal region of SAMD9L. Growth studies with nearly all OPXV species showed that the ability of OPXVs to antagonize chSAMD9L correlates with CP77 gene status and that a functional CP77 ortholog was maintained in many OPXVs, including monkeypox virus. Our data suggest that a species-specific difference in rodent SAMD9L poses a barrier for cross-species OPXV infection and that OPXVs have evolved three SAMD9&L inhibitors with different specificities to overcome this barrier.IMPORTANCE Several OPXV species, including monkeypox virus and cowpox virus, cause zoonotic infection in humans. They are believed to use wild rodents as the reservoir or intermediate hosts, but the host or viral factors that are important for OPXV host range in rodents are unknown. Here, we showed that the abortive replication of several OPXV species in a Chinese hamster cell line was caused by a species-specific difference in the host antiviral factor SAMD9L, suggesting that SAMD9L divergence in different rodent species poses a barrier for cross-species OPXV infection. While the Chinese hamster SAMD9L could not be inhibited by two previously identified OPXV inhibitors of human and mouse SAMD9&L, it can be inhibited by cowpox virus CP77, indicating that OPXVs encode three SAMD9&L inhibitors with different specificities. Our data suggest that OPXV host range in broad rodent species depends on three SAMD9&L inhibitors with different specificities.	4	Information Unavailable	host range; host restriction factor; poxvirus; vaccinia virus	10.1128/JVI.00225-19	Zhang F, Meng X, Townsend MB, Satheshkumar PS, Xiang Y.

35215981	An Update of Orthopoxvirus Molecular Evolution	Although variola virus (VARV) has been eradicated through widespread vaccination, other orthopoxviruses pathogenic for humans circulate in nature. Recently, new orthopoxviruses, including some able to infect humans, have been found and their complete genomes have been sequenced. Questions about the orthopoxvirus mutation rate and the emergence of new threats to humankind as a result of the evolution of circulating orthopoxviruses remain open. Based on contemporary data on ancient VARV DNA and DNA of new orthopoxvirus species, an analysis of the molecular evolution of orthopoxviruses was carried out and the timescale of their emergence was estimated. It was calculated that the orthopoxviruses of the Old and New Worlds separated approximately 40,000 years ago; the recently discovered Akhmeta virus and Alaskapox virus separated from other orthopoxviruses approximately 10,000-20,000 years ago; the rest of modern orthopoxvirus species originated from 1700 to 6000 years ago, with the exception of VARV, which emerged in approximately 300 AD. Later, there was a separation of genetic variants of some orthopoxvirus species, so the monkeypox virus West African subtype originated approximately 600 years ago, and the VARV minor alastrim subtype emerged approximately 300 years ago.

2389555	Sequence and evolutionary relationships of African swine fever virus thymidine kinase	The thymidine kinase gene of African swine fever virus was mapped in a 1.4-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment located in the left half of the Eco RI K fragment of African swine fever virus DNA by using degenerate oligonucleotide probes derived from regions of the thymidine kinase sequence conserved in several poxviruses, man, mouse, and chicken. The nucleotide sequence of this region revealed an open reading frame of 196 codons, whose translated amino acid sequence showed significant similarity to the thymidine kinases of vaccinia virus, variola virus, monkeypox virus, shope fibroma virus, fowlpox virus, capripox virus, man, mouse, and chicken. The similarity scores obtained after comparison of known thymidine kinase sequences indicated that the African swine fever virus thymidine kinase is more distantly related than the poxvirus thymidine kinases to their cellular homologs. The evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/0042-6822(90)90409-k	Blasco R, López-Otín C, Muñóz M, Bockamp EO, Simón-Mateo C, Viñuela E.

16796038	A history of biological disasters of animal origin in North America	This paper examines past occurrences in North America relevant to the possibility of biological disasters with animal origins. With respect to naturally occurring animal disease outbreaks, North America, while not as adversely affected by epizootics as other regions, has had its fair share of such outbreaks of both 'traditional' and emerging animal diseases. The traditional category includes such diseases as anthrax, classical swine fever, bluetongue, brucellosis, foot and mouth disease, and the family of equine encephalomyelitis viruses. The emerging diseases include relatively more recent culprits such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, poultry enteritis mortality syndrome, and newly discovered examples of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Additionally, several serious diseases of human beings that involve animal vectors or reservoirs occur naturally in North America or have emerged in recent decades; these include plague, hantavirus, monkeypox, West Nile virus and avian-derived influenza. At the same time, there have been very few intentional attacks on livestock using biological agents and no recorded cases in North America of animals intentionally being used to transmit disease to humans. According to the historical record, therefore, naturally occurring emerging zoonoses probably constitute the greatest threat in terms of biological disasters with animal origins. However, some of the general trends in terrorist activity, such as the intensification of activities by animal rights extremists against facilities undertaking animal research, mean that the possibility of intentional animal-related biological disasters should not be discounted.	2	Review	Information Unavailable	10.20506/rst.25.1.1653	Ackerman GA, Giroux J.

15714487	Effective poxvirus removal by sterile filtration during manufacture of plasma derivatives	As a consequence of the September 2001 terrorist events, programs to protect against further such acts including potentially the use of biological warfare agents have been launched in the USA and elsewhere. As part of these initiatives, Vaccinia virus was procured for the pre-emptive vaccination of key personnel against smallpox as well as population-wide protection after an eventual exposure. The introduction of this live virus into a population at a relatively large scale represents a theoretical challenge for the safety of the blood supply, and potentially for plasma for fractionation. To strengthen further the demonstration of safety margins for plasma derived products against Vaccinia virus, the capacity of sterile filtration procedures to remove the virus was investigated. An infectivity assay for the Vaccinia virus strain which represents the majority of smallpox vaccine stocks available currently was used to investigate the potential removal of this virus by sterile filtration processes during the manufacture of plasma derivatives. Vaccinia virus behaves as predicted based on its size, i.e., an artificially added virus load is removed about 10,000-fold by the sterile filtration procedures tested. As the current investigation covered a range of different protein concentrations, filter materials and filters from different manufacturers, the results obtained are considered to be widely applicable. The current investigation supports further the high safety margins of plasma derivatives against any potential Vaccinia virus content of plasma for fractionation. As the large size is a general feature of Orthopox viruses, the results would also provide assurance against poxviruses identified more recently, for example, Monkeypox virus.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.20299	Berting A, Goerner W, Spruth M, Kistner O, Kreil TR.

20191435	Tecovirimat, a p37 envelope protein inhibitor for the treatment of smallpox infection	Since the eradication of naturally occurring smallpox in 1980, the fear that variola virus could be used as a biological weapon has become real. Over the last 10 years, emergency preparedness programs have been launched to protect populations against a smallpox outbreak or the possible emergence in humans of other orthopoxvirus infections, such as monkeypox. Vaccination against smallpox was responsible for its eradication, but was linked with high rates of adverse events and contraindications. In this context, intensive research in the poxvirus field has led to the development of safer vaccines and to an increase in the number of anti-poxvirus agents in the pipeline. SIGA Technologies Inc, under license from ViroPharma Inc, is developing tecovirimat (ST-246). Tecovirimat is a novel antiviral that inhibits the egress of orthopoxviruses by targeting viral p37 protein orthologs. The development of tecovirimat during the last 5 years for the treatment of smallpox and for its potential use as adjunct to smallpox vaccine is reviewed here.	5	Review	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Duraffour S, Andrei G, Snoeck R.

15587263	Preparing for an era of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)--are we there yet? Why we should all be concerned. Part II	"September 11, 2001 demonstrated dramatic voids in national preparedness, and catalyzed massive efforts to identify and remedy vulnerabilities. Since Part I of this series appeared in August 2002, significant improvements have been achieved especially in bioterrorism and chemical terrorism for first responders and emergency medicine, law enforcement, and public health (surveillance). Such efforts manifested benefits during the SARS outbreaks and monkeypox cases of 2003. Nevertheless, emerging infectious diseases will continue to pose a threat if we do not remain vigilant and continue to invest in training, surveillance, and treatments. As expected, many poison centers and toxicologists have taken leadership roles nationwide. In regions where such leadership existed, preparedness levels are strong and collaborations resulted in the development of valuable response plans and training, including the Advanced Hazardous Life Support (AHLS) and Basic Disaster Life Support (BDLS) courses. Early success notwithstanding, experts suggest that current national preparedness has improved slightly from ""1"" (9/11) to ""3"" out of ""10"". Increasingly it has become evident that the nuclear threat, including radiation terrorism, is significant, against which the US remains inadequately prepared. Arguably the nuclear threat-whether accidental or planned-remains our highest consequence vulnerability, and we must rapidly improve our readiness across disciplines. Special populations including the elderly and children remain marginalized in preparedness protocols. Local vulnerabilities including chemical manufacturing and transportation--not just a risk for terrorism but industrial accidents--continue unabated. Our early success is not an endpoint; much work remains and time is fleeting. This report examines vulnerabilities that must be addressed to enhance preparedness."	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	McFee RB, Leikin JB, Kiernan K.

18825952	[Molecular evolution of poxviruses]	Previous restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis divided variola virus (VARV) strains into two subtypes, one of which included West African and South American isolates. This allowed a dating to be introduced for the first time in estimation of the VARV evolution rate. The results were used to analyze the molecular evolution of the total family Poxviridae. Comparisons of the known nucleotide sequences were performed for the extended conserved central genome region in 42 orthopoxvirus strains and for the eight genes of multisubunit RNA polymerase in 65 viruses belonging to various genera of the family Poxviridae. Using the Bayesian dating method, the mutation accumulation rate of poxviruses was estimated at (1.7-8.8) x 10(-6) nucleotide substitutions per site per year. Computations showed that the modem poxvirus genera started diverging from an ancestral virus more than 200 thousand years ago and that an ancestor of the genus Orthopoxvirus emerged 131 +/- 45 thousand years ago. The other genera of mammalian poxviruses with a low GC content diverged approximately 110-90 thousand years ago. The independent evolution of VARV started 3.4 +/- 0.8 thousand years ago. It was shown with the example of VARV and the monkeypox virus (MPXV) that divergent evolution of these orthopoxviruses started and the West African subtypes of VARV and MPXV were formed as geographical conditions changed to allow isolation of West African animals from other African regions.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Babkin IV, Shelkunov SN.

17283610	Prophylaxis and treatment of pregnant women for emerging infections and bioterrorism emergencies	Emerging infectious disease outbreaks and bioterrorism attacks warrant urgent public health and medical responses. Response plans for these events may include use of medications and vaccines for which the effects on pregnant women and fetuses are unknown. Healthcare providers must be able to discuss the benefits and risks of these interventions with their pregnant patients. Recent experiences with outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, monkeypox, and anthrax, as well as response planning for bioterrorism and pandemic influenza, illustrate the challenges of making recommendations about treatment and prophylaxis for pregnant women. Understanding the physiology of pregnancy, the factors that influence the teratogenic potential of medications and vaccines, and the infection control measures that may stop an outbreak will aid planners in making recommendations for care of pregnant women during large-scale infectious disease emergencies.	16	Review	Information Unavailable	10.3201/eid1211.060618	Cono J, Cragan JD, Jamieson DJ, Rasmussen SA.

26426117	Development of a High-Content Orthopoxvirus Infectivity and Neutralization Assays	Currently, a number of assays measure Orthopoxvirus neutralization with serum from individuals, vaccinated against smallpox. In addition to the traditional plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), newer higher throughput assays are based on neutralization of recombinant vaccinia virus, expressing reporter genes such as β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein. These methods could not be used to evaluate neutralization of variola virus, since genetic manipulations of this virus are prohibited by international agreements. Currently, PRNT is the assay of choice to measure neutralization of variola virus. However, PRNT assays are time consuming, labor intensive, and require considerable volume of serum sample for testing. Here, we describe the development of a high-throughput, cell-based imaging assay that can be used to measure neutralization, and characterize replication kinetics of various Orthopoxviruses, including variola, vaccinia, monkeypox, and cowpox.

21858000	Chasing Jenner&#x27;s vaccine: revisiting cowpox virus classification	"Cowpox virus (CPXV) is described as the source of the first vaccine used to prevent the onset and spread of an infectious disease. It is one of the earliest described members of the genus Orthopoxvirus, which includes the viruses that cause smallpox and monkeypox in humans. Both the historic and current literature describe ""cowpox"" as a disease with a single etiologic agent. Genotypic data presented herein indicate that CPXV is not a single species, but a composite of several (up to 5) species that can infect cows, humans, and other animals. The practice of naming agents after the host in which the resultant disease manifests obfuscates the true taxonomic relationships of ""cowpox"" isolates. These data support the elevation of as many as four new species within the traditional ""cowpox"" group and suggest that both wild and modern vaccine strains of Vaccinia virus are most closely related to CPXV of continental Europe rather than the United Kingdom, the homeland of the vaccine."	53	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0023086	Carroll DS, Emerson GL, Li Y, Sammons S, Olson V, Frace M, Nakazawa Y, Czerny CP, Tryland M, Kolodziejek J, Nowotny N, Olsen-Rasmussen M, Khristova M, Govil D, Karem K, Damon IK, Meyer H.

11328613	A review of topical and intralesional cidofovir	Cidofovir is a potent nucleoside analog antiviral drug approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is currently available only for intravenous infusion. Several small studies and case reports describe the successful use of cidofovir applied either topically or by intralesional injection in several virally induced cutaneous diseases. Available information demonstrates that cidofovir is a potent antiviral agent with activity against several DNA viruses that cause cutaneous disease when applied topically or administered by intralesional injection. No significant systemic side effects have been noted, although application site reactions are common and can occasionally be severe. The effective use of topical and intralesional cidofovir for the treatment of diseases of the skin caused by DNA viruses has been demonstrated in animals and a limited number of patients including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This article reviews the pharmacology of cidofovir and the utility of topical and intralesional cidofovir for the treatment of viral infections caused by human papillomavirus, herpesviruses (including acyclovir resistant strains), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, molluscum contagiosum and monkeypox.	5	Review	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Zabawski EJ Jr.	Dermatol Online J. 2000 Sep;6(1):3.
22427855	In vitro characterization of a nineteenth-century therapy for smallpox	In the nineteenth century, smallpox ravaged through the United States and Canada. At this time, a botanical preparation, derived from the carnivorous plant Sarracenia purpurea, was proclaimed as being a successful therapy for smallpox infections. The work described characterizes the antipoxvirus activity associated with this botanical extract against vaccinia virus, monkeypox virus and variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. Our work demonstrates the in vitro characterization of Sarracenia purpurea as the first effective inhibitor of poxvirus replication at the level of early viral transcription. With the renewed threat of poxvirus-related infections, our results indicate Sarracenia purpurea may act as another defensive measure against Orthopoxvirus infections.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0032610	Arndt W, Mitnik C, Denzler KL, White S, Waters R, Jacobs BL, Rochon Y, Olson VA, Damon IK, Langland JO.

20433668	The Nebraska experience in biocontainment patient care	Public health nurses in local health departments may receive the first call regarding a potential case of avian influenza, monkeypox, or viral hemorrhagic fever. One public health approach to containing these dangerous infectious disease outbreaks is the use of specialized isolation units. Early access to a biocontainment patient care unit (BPCU) for isolation during a bioterrorism or public health emergency event along with appropriate use of epidemiological and therapeutic interventions in the community may dramatically impact the size and severity of a disease outbreak (Smith et al., 2006). As emerging infectious agents, pandemics, resistant organisms, and terrorism continue to threaten human life; health care and emergency care providers must be empowered to work with nurses and other professionals in public health to plan for the consequences. This article describes the evolution of Nebraska's BPCU strategy for public health preparedness in the face of a biological threat. Design priorities, unit management, challenges, and lessons learned will be shared to guide others in establishing similar infrastructure.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.1525-1446.2010.00837.x	Beam EL, Boulter KC, Freihaut F, Schwedhelm S, Smith PW.

17765007	Viremia in human Cowpox virus infection	Background: Several poxviruses can infect humans and cause diseases of varying severity. Besides the eradicated Variola virus that induced high mortality rates, numerous further human pathogenic orthopoxviruses are potentially fatal but generally cause less severe infections. While infection-related viremia was described for Variola virus and seems to be rare for Monkeypox virus, it is still debated for Vaccinia virus. So far, viremia in Cowpox virus-infected humans has not been reported. Objectives: To estimate the potential risk of Cowpox virus to disseminate and develop severe infections, two Cowpox virus patients were examined for viremia. Study design: Whole blood, serum and fluid from virus-induced lesions were analyzed by serology or quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Real-time PCR and sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene confirmed Cowpox virus in the lesions of both patients. Serology performed on serum obtained at the same time as the lesion specimens demonstrated orthopoxvirus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies, indicating a recent orthopoxvirus infection. In addition, Cowpox virus DNA was detectable in whole blood, but not in serum, as late as week 4 post-infection. Conclusions: In contrast to observations following vaccination with Vaccinia virus, DNAemia in patients with localized symptoms of a Cowpox virus infection does not seem to be a rare event. However, its relevance for Cowpox virus pathogenicity has to be elucidated.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jcv.2007.07.014	Nitsche A, Kurth A, Pauli G.

17228320	Immunopathogenesis of poxvirus infections: forecasting the impending storm	Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is a member of the poxvirus family and one of the most virulent human pathogens known. Although smallpox was eradicated almost 30 years ago, it is not understood why the mortality rates associated with the disease were high, why some patients recovered, and what constitutes an effective host response against infection. As variola virus infects only humans, our current understanding of poxvirus infections comes largely from historical clinical data from smallpox patients and from animal studies using closely related viruses such as ectromelia, myxoma and monkeypox. The outcome of an infection is determined by a complex interaction between the type of immune response mounted by the host and by evasion mechanisms that the virus has evolved to subvert it. Disease pathogenesis is also a function of both host and viral factors. Poxviruses are not only cytopathic, causing host tissue damage, but also encode an array of immunomodulatory molecules that affect the severity of disease. The ability of the host to control virus replication is therefore critical in limiting tissue damage. However, in addition to targeting virus, the immune response can inadvertently damage the host to such a degree that it causes illness and even death. There is growing evidence that many of the symptoms associated with serious poxvirus infections are a result of a 'cytokine storm' or sepsis and that this may be the underlying cause of pathology.	34	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1038/sj.icb.7100033	Stanford MM, McFadden G, Karupiah G, Chaudhri G.

16054706	Real-time PCR assay for the detection of tanapox virus and yaba-like disease virus	The yatapoxvirus genus contains three members: tanapox virus (TPV), yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) and yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV), two of which (TPV and YLDV) may infect humans. However, only a very small number of patients have been diagnosed with TPV outside Africa. Given the increased international travel and the similarity of clinical signs during the early stages of a TPV/YLDV infection as compared to diseases caused by agents of potential biological warfare, such as smallpox, monkeypox, tularemia and anthrax, the rapid and reliable recognition of a TPV/YLDV infection is crucial. A real-time PCR assay using TaqManchemistry was developed in order to identify unambiguously TPV/YLDV. Primers and probe targeting a 101bp region of the PstI L fragment of TPV, initial optimisations steps were carried out with YLDV DNA as template. Using probit regression analysis, the lower limit of detection was calculated to be ca. 8 copies per assay. A total of five TPV strains, one YDLV strain and scab-derived DNA from a patient with a TPV infection yielded specific amplification, whereas the DNA of YMTV was not amplified. Various viral and bacterial pathogens (n=29) associated with rash-causing illnesses were not detected using this assay.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jviromet.2005.06.015	Zimmermann P, Thordsen I, Frangoulidis D, Meyer H.

15738948	Poxvirus tropism	Despite the success of the WHO-led smallpox eradication programme a quarter of a century ago, there remains considerable fear that variola virus, or other related pathogenic poxviruses such as monkeypox, could re-emerge and spread disease in the human population. Even today, we are still mostly ignorant about why most poxvirus infections of vertebrate hosts show strict species specificity, or how zoonotic poxvirus infections occur when poxviruses occasionally leap into novel host species. Poxvirus tropism at the cellular level seems to be regulated by intracellular events downstream of virus binding and entry, rather than at the level of specific host receptors as is the case for many other viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of poxvirus tropism and host range, and discusses the prospects of exploiting host-restricted poxvirus vectors for vaccines, gene therapy or tissue-targeted oncolytic viral therapies for the treatment of human cancers.	181	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1038/nrmicro1099	McFadden G.

19637933	Analysis of vaccinia virus-host protein-protein interactions: validations of yeast two-hybrid screenings	Vaccinia virus, a large double-stranded DNA virus, is the prototype of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes several pathogenic poxviruses of humans, such as monkeypox virus and variola virus. Here, we report a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening for the protein-protein interactions between vaccinia and human proteins. A total of 109 novel vaccinia-human protein interactions were detected among 33 viral proteins. To validate subsets of those interactions, we constructed an ORFeome library of vaccinia virus strain WR using the Gateway plasmid cloning system. By co-expressing selected vaccinia and host proteins in a variety of expression systems, we found that at least 17 of the Y2H hits identified between vaccinia and human proteins can be verified by independent methods using GST pull-down assays, representing a 63% validation rate for the Y2H hits examined (17/27). Because the cloned ORFs are conveniently transferable from the entry vectors to various destination expression vectors, the vaccinia ORFeome library will be a useful resource for future high-throughput functional proteomic experiments.	38	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1021/pr900491n	Zhang L, Villa NY, Rahman MM, Smallwood S, Shattuck D, Neff C, Dufford M, Lanchbury JS, Labaer J, McFadden G.

15552764	Combining the benefits of decision science and financial analysis in public health management: a county-specific budgeting and planning model	State public health agencies are charged with providing and overseeing the management of basic public health services on a population-wide basis. These activities have a re-emphasized focus as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent anthrax events, and the continuing importance placed on bioterrorism preparedness, West Nile virus, and emerging infectious diseases (eg, monkeypox, SARS). This has added to the tension that exists in budgeting and planning, given the diverse constituencies that are served in each state. State health agencies must be prepared to allocate finite resources in a more formal manner to be able to provide basic public health services on a routine basis, as well as during outbreaks. This article describes the use of an analytical approach to assist financial analysis that is used for budgeting and planning in a state health agency. The combined benefits of decision science and financial analysis are needed to adequately and appropriately plan and budget to meet the diverse needs of the populations within a state. Health and financial indicators are incorporated into a decision model, based on multicriteria decision theory, that has been employed to acquire information about counties and public health programs areas within a county, that reflect the impact of planning and budgeting efforts. This information can be used to allocate resources, to distribute funds for health care services, and to guide public health finance policy formulation and implementation.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1097/00124784-200409000-00006	Fos PJ, Miller DL, Amy BW, Zuniga MA.

12615301	In vitro activity of potential anti-poxvirus agents	The potential use of variola or another orthopoxvirus such as monkeypox as a weapon of bioterrorism has stimulated efforts to develop new drugs for treatment of smallpox or other poxvirus infections. At the present time only cidofovir is approved for use in the emergency treatment of smallpox outbreaks. Although cidofovir is very active against the orthopoxviruses in vitro and in animal model infections, it is not active when given orally and must be administered with precaution so as to avoid renal toxicity. In an attempt to identify alternative treatment modalities for these infections we have determined the anti-poxvirus activity in vitro of most of the approved antiviral agents as well as a number of cidofovir analogs and prodrugs. From these studies, we have identified the nucleotide analog, adefovir dipivoxil, some alkoxyalkyl esters of cidofovir and a number of prodrugs of cidofovir that warrant further investigation as potential therapies for smallpox or other orthopoxvirus infections.	29	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0166-3542(02)00198-5	Kern ER.

9599592	Real-time microchip PCR for detecting single-base differences in viral and human DNA	This report describes real-time 5' nuclease PCR assays to rapidly distinguish single-base polymorphism using a battery-powered miniature analytical thermal cycling instrument (MATCI). Orthopoxviruses and the human complement component C6 gene served as targets to demonstrate the feasibility of using the MATCI for diagnosis of infectious diseases and genetic disorders. In the Orthopoxvirus assay, consensus Orthopoxvirus PCR primers were designed to amplify 266-281 base-pair (bp) segments of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene in camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia viruses. A vaccinia virus-specific fluorogenic (TaqMan) probe was designed to detect a single-base (A/G) substitution within the HA gene. In the C6 gene assay, a 73-bp segment of the C6 gene was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA, and TaqMan probes were used to detect a single-base (A/C) polymorphism in the second position of codon 98. The MATCI correctly identified the nucleotide differences in both viral DNA and human genomic DNA. In addition, using a rapid DNA preparation method, it was possible to achieve sample, preparation of human genomic DNA, DNA amplification, and real-time detection in less than 1 h.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1021/ac971091u	Ibrahim MS, Lofts RS, Jahrling PB, Henchal EA, Weedn VW, Northrup MA, Belgrader P.

27933782	Integration of Global Analyses of Host Molecular Responses with Clinical Data To Evaluate Pathogenesis and Advance Therapies for Emerging and Re-emerging Viral Infections	Outbreaks associated with emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens continue to increase in frequency and are associated with an increasing burden to global health. In light of this, there is a need to integrate basic and clinical research for investigating the connections between molecular and clinical pathogenesis and for therapeutic development strategies. Here, we will discuss this approach with a focus on the emerging viral pathogens Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and monkeypox virus (MPXV) from the context of clinical presentation, immunological and molecular features of the diseases, and OMICS-based analyses of pathogenesis. Furthermore, we will highlight the role of global investigations of host kinases, the kinome, for investigating emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens from the context of characterizing cellular responses and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Lastly, we will address how increased integration of clinical and basic research will assist treatment and prevention efforts for emerging pathogens.	1	Review	cell signaling; emerging pathogens; high-consequence pathogens; kinases; kinomics; virology	10.1021/acsinfecdis.6b00104	Falcinelli SD, Chertow DS, Kindrachuk J.

25311190	Identification and characterization of a phage display-derived peptide for orthopoxvirus detection	Fast and reliable diagnostic assays are required for a resilient detection of clinical infections or biothreat-relevant pathogens. While PCR has proven to be the gold standard for nucleic acid detection, the identification of pathogen particles is still challenging and depends on the availability of well-characterized, chemically stable, and selective recognition molecules. Here, we report the screening of a phage display random peptide library for vaccinia virus-binding peptides. The identified peptide was extensively characterized using peptide-probe ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, nLC-MS/MS, Western Blot, peptide-based immunofluorescence assay, and electron microscopy. Following identification, the phage-free, synthetic peptide, designated αVACVpep05, was shown to bind to vaccinia virus and other orthopoxviruses. We can demonstrate that the highly conserved orthopoxvirus surface protein D8 is the interaction partner of αVACVpep05, thus enabling the peptide to bind to other orthopoxviruses, including cowpox virus and monkeypox virus, viruses that cause clinically relevant zoonotic infections in humans. The process of phage display-mediated peptide identification has been optimized intensively, and we provide recommendations for the identification of peptides suitable for the detection of further pathogens. The peptide described here was critically characterized and seems to be a promising reagent for the development of diagnostic platforms for orthopoxviruses. We believe that our results will help to promote the development of alternative, nonantibody-based synthetic detection molecules for further pathogens.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1007/s00216-014-8150-8	Miller L, Michel J, Vogt G, Döllinger J, Stern D, Piesker J, Nitsche A.

15828843	Combinatorial optimization of isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazones as anti-poxvirus agents	Novel strategies are required to combat pox virus infections, whether caused by escape of viruses such as monkeypox from indigenous areas or intentional release of smallpox. Anti-smallpox drugs with a unique mode of antiviral action, inhibition of transcription termination, were known but not therapeutically useful. Using a combinatorial method, variants of the basic isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazone structure were prepared and examined for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity in vaccinia virus- and cowpox virus-infected human cells. Potent and much more selective N-aminomethyl-isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazones were discovered.	14	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1021/jm049147h	Pirrung MC, Pansare SV, Sarma KD, Keith KA, Kern ER.

20682806	Animal models of orthopoxvirus infection	Smallpox was one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity. Although smallpox was eradicated through a historically successful vaccination campaign, there is concern in the global community that either Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, or another species of Orthopoxvirus could be used as agents of bioterrorism. Therefore, development of countermeasures to Orthopoxvirus infection is a crucial focus in biodefense research, and these efforts rely on the use of various animal models. Smallpox typically presented as a generalized pustular rash with 30 to 40% mortality, and although smallpox-like syndromes can be induced in cynomolgus macaques with VARV, research with this virus is highly restricted; therefore, animal models with other orthopoxviruses have been investigated. Monkeypox virus causes a generalized vesiculopustular rash in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques and induces fatal systemic disease in several rodent species. Ectromelia virus has been extensively studied in mice as a model of orthopoxviral infection in its natural host. Intranasal inoculation of mice with some strains of vaccinia virus produces fatal bronchopneumonia, as does aerosol or intranasal inoculation of mice with cowpox virus. Rabbitpox virus causes pneumonia and fatal systemic infections in rabbits and can be naturally transmitted between rabbits by an aerosol route similar to that of VARV in humans. No single animal model recapitulates all known aspects of human Orthopoxvirus infections, and each model has its advantages and disadvantages. This article provides a brief review of the Orthopoxvirus diseases of humans and the key pathologic features of animal models of Orthopoxvirus infections.	50	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1177/0300985810378649	Chapman JL, Nichols DK, Martinez MJ, Raymond JW.

20013871	Potential attractants for detecting and removing invading Gambian giant pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus)	Background: Native to Africa, Gambian giant pouched rats (Gambian rats; Cricetomys gambianus Waterh.) are a threatening invasive species on a Florida island, Grassy Key. Gambian giant pouched rats shifted from a domestic pet to invading species after suspected release from a pet breeder. Because of the large size of Gambian rats (weighing up to 2.8 kg), they pose a serious threat to native species (particularly nesting species) and agricultural crops, especially if Gambian rats invade mainland Florida. Also, Gambian rats pose a threat from disease, as they were implicated in a monkeypox outbreak in the midwestern United States in 2003. The United States Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services has initiated eradication and detection efforts in the Florida Keys, but trapping the sparse population of Gambian rats has proven difficult. Results: Fifteen attractants that could be used in traps for capturing or detecting single or paired Gambian rats were tested. It was found that conspecific scents (i.e. feces and urine) from other Gambian rats were the best treatment for attracting single and paired Gambian rats. Single Gambian rats explored more attractant types than paired Gambian rats. Conclusions: Effective attractants for use with Gambian rats have been identified, and multiple attractant types should be used to capture or detect the sparse population. It is recommended that mainly urine and feces from Gambian rats be used, but peanut butter, anise, ginger and fatty acid scent could also be useful for attracting the currently small population of Gambian rats on Grassy Key.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1002/ps.1892	Witmer GW, Snow NP, Burke PW.

17388078	Agroterrorism: where are we in the ongoing war on terrorism?	The U.S. agricultural infrastructure is one of the most productive and efficient food-producing systems in the world. Many of the characteristics that contribute to its high productivity and efficiency also make this infrastructure extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack by a biological weapon. Several experts have repeatedly stated that taking advantage of these vulnerabilities would not require a significant undertaking and that the nation's agricultural infrastructure remains highly vulnerable. As a result of continuing criticism, many initiatives at all levels of government and within the private sector have been undertaken to improve our ability to detect and respond to an agroterrorist attack. However, outbreaks, such as the 1999 West Nile outbreak, the 2001 anthrax attacks, the 2003 monkeypox outbreak, and the 2004 Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak, have demonstrated the need for improvements in the areas of communication, emergency response and surveillance efforts, and education for all levels of government, the agricultural community, and the private sector. We recommend establishing an interdisciplinary advisory group that consists of experts from public health, human health, and animal health communities to prioritize improvement efforts in these areas. The primary objective of this group would include establishing communication, surveillance, and education benchmarks to determine current weaknesses in preparedness and activities designed to mitigate weaknesses. We also recommend broader utilization of current food and agricultural preparedness guidelines, such as those developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.	2	Review	Information Unavailable	10.4315/0362-028x-70.3.791	Crutchley TM, Rodgers JB, Whiteside HP Jr, Vanier M, Terndrup TE.

12076747	Cidofovir in the treatment of poxvirus infections	Cidofovir [(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine, HPMPC] has since 1996 been licensed for clinical use in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. Cidofovir has broad-spectrum activity against virtually all DNA viruses, including herpes-, adeno-, polyoma-, papilloma- and poxviruses. Among the poxviruses, vaccinia, variola (smallpox), cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, molluscum contagiosum and orf have proven sensitive to the inhibitory effects of cidofovir. In vivo, cidofovir has shown high efficacy, even after administration of a single systemic (intraperitoneal) or intranasal (aerosolized) dose, in protecting mice from a lethal respiratory infection with either vaccinia or cowpox. Cidofovir has also demonstrated high effectiveness in the treatment of vaccinia virus infection in severe combined immune deficiency mice. In humans, cidofovir has been used successfully in the treatment, by both the topical and intravenous route, of recalcitrant molluscum contagiosum and orf in immunocompromised patients. Taken together, these data indicate that cidofovir should be effective in the therapy and short-term prophylaxis of smallpox and related poxvirus infections in humans, as well as the treatment of the complications of vaccinia that may arise in immunocompromised patients inadvertently inoculated with the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia).	53	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0166-3542(02)00008-6	De Clercq E.

PCR assay for laboratory detection of smallpox virus. PCR primers and probes were designed specifically for detection of smallpox virus DNA, but all viruses of the genus Orthopoxvirus tested could be detected by use of the hemagglutinin gene target sequence. Base pair mismatches in the 204-bp amplicon allowed discrimination of cowpox virus (melting temperature [T(m)], 56.40 degrees C), monkeypox virus (T(m), 56.24 degrees C), and vaccinia virus (T(m), 56.72 degrees C), including the Dryvax vaccine strain, from smallpox virus (T(m), 62.45 degrees C) by melting curve analysis. The analytical sensitivity was 5 to 10 copies of target DNA per sample. The assay was specific for members of the genus Orthopoxvirus; the DNAs of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus were not detected by the smallpox virus LightCycler PCR.	23	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JCM.40.6.1985-1988.2002	Espy MJ, Cockerill III FR, Meyer RF, Bowen MD, Poland GA, Hadfield TL, Smith TF.

7559950	PCR strategy for identification and differentiation of small pox and other orthopoxviruses	Rapid identification and differentiation of orthopoxviruses by PCR were achieved with primers based on genome sequences encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, an infected-cell membrane antigen that distinguishes orthopoxviruses from other poxvirus genera. The initial identification step used a primer pair of consensus sequences for amplifying an HA DNA fragment from the three known North American orthopoxviruses (raccoonpox, skunkpox, and volepox viruses), and a second pair for amplifying virtually the entire HA open reading frame of the Eurasian-African orthopoxviruses (variola, vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox, ectromelia, and gerbilpox viruses). RsaI digest electropherograms of the amplified DNAs of the former subgroup provided species differentiation, and TaqI digests differentiated the Eurasian-African orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia virus from the vaccinia virus subspecies buffalopox virus. Endonuclease HhaI digest patterns distinguished smallpox variola major viruses from alastrim variola minor viruses. For the Eurasian-African orthopoxviruses, a confirmatory step that used a set of higher-sequence-homology primers was developed to provide sensitivity to discern individual virus HA DNAs from cross-contaminated orthopoxvirus DNA samples; TaqI and HhaI digestions of the individual amplified HA DNAs confirmed virus identity. Finally, a set of primers and modified PCR conditions were developed on the basis of base sequence differences within the HA genes of the 10 species, which enabled production of a single DNA fragment of a particular size that indicated the specific species.	61	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1128/jcm.33.8.2069-2076.1995	Ropp SL, Jin Q, Knight JC, Massung RF, Esposito JJ.

30281950	Propagation and Purification of Ectromelia Virus	Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is an orthopoxvirus that causes mousepox in mice. Members of the genus orthopoxvirus are closely related and include variola (the causative agent of smallpox in humans), monkeypox, and vaccinia. Common features of variola virus and ECTV further include a restricted host range and similar disease progression in their respective hosts. Mousepox makes an excellent small animal model for smallpox to investigate pathogenesis, vaccine and antiviral agent testing, host-virus interactions, and immune and inflammatory responses. The availability of a wide variety of inbred, congenic, and gene-knockout mice allows detailed analyses of the host response. ECTV mutant viruses lacking one or more genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins are being used in numerous studies in conjunction with wild-type or gene-knockout mice to study the functions of these genes in host-virus interactions. The methods used for propagation of ECTV in cell culture, purification, and quantification of infectious particles through viral plaque assay are described. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	3	Information Unavailable	ectromelia virus; orthopoxvirus; poxvirus; virus plaque assay; virus purification	10.1002/cpmc.65	Chaudhri G, Kaladimou G, Pandey P, Karupiah G.

16597852	Follow-up on diagnostic proficiency of laboratories equipped to perform orthopoxvirus detection and quantification by PCR: the second international external quality assurance study	Two years after the first external quality assurance study on bioterrorism-relevant viruses, we have conducted a follow-up study on orthopoxvirus detection by PCR. Thirty-three laboratories (27 European, 4 Austral-Asian, and 2 American) participated. Samples contained 0 to 40,000,000 DNA copies of lyophilized monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia virus per ml. Laboratories achieved a >80% detection chance above 56,234 copies per ml. Global sensitivity was not significantly improved over that of the first study. Twenty-seven and 9 participants, respectively, were able to genotype and quantify virus. Four of 27 genotyping results were incorrect. Quantification accuracy was significantly better for vaccinia virus than for the other viruses. False-positive results occurred in 22 (11.8%) of all 186 tests on negative samples, but 18 of these were contributed by only five laboratories. Fifty-five percent of laboratories could appropriately detect PCR inhibition. The use of either real-time PCR or commercial diagnostic kits had significant positive influence on laboratory performance.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JCM.44.4.1283-1287.2006	Niedrig M, Meyer H, Panning M, Drosten C.

15777195	Orthopoxvirus targets for the development of antiviral therapies	The potential use of smallpox virus as a bioterror agent and the endemic presence of monkeypox virus in Africa underscores the need for better therapies for orthopoxvirus infections. The only existing clinical experience treating vaccinia and smallpox infections has been with Marboran, which suggested that antiviral therapies could be effective in treating and preventing smallpox infections, but this compound has not been pursued. Drugs that have been approved for other indications, like cidofovir, could be approved for the treatment of orthopoxvirus infections in a timely manner, and this compound has already been approved for emergency treatment of smallpox and complications from vaccination. Its lack of activity when given orally, however, limits its use in a major outbreak involving large numbers of people exposed to the virus. The discovery and development of new therapies can be achieved more rapidly by drawing on the experience and successes with other antiviral agents, particularly with the herpesviruses. This review will discuss the orthopoxvirus replication cycle in detail noting specific viral functions and their associated gene products that have the potential to serve as new targets for drug design and development. This discussion is designed to help investigators relate these targets to parallel functions and existing assays in other virus systems that have been used successfully in drug development. The rapid progress that has been achieved in recent years should yield new drugs for the treatment of these infections and might also reveal new strategies for antiviral therapy with other viruses.	9	Review	Information Unavailable	10.2174/1568005053174627	Prichard MN, Kern ER.

19619625	Evolution of the Schlafen genes, a gene family associated with embryonic lethality, meiotic drive, immune processes and orthopoxvirus virulence	Genes of the Schlafen family, first discovered in mouse, are expressed in hematopoietic cells and are involved in immune processes. Previous results showed that they are candidate genes for two major phenomena: meiotic drive and embryonic lethality (DDK syndrome). However, these genes remain poorly understood, mostly due to the limitations imposed by their similarity, close location and the potential functional redundancy of the gene family members. Here we use genomic and phylogenetic studies to investigate the evolution and role of this family of genes. Our results show that the Schlafen family is widely distributed in mammals, where we recognize four major clades that experienced lineage-specific expansions or contractions in various orders, including primates and rodents. In addition, we identified members of the Schlafen family in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia, indicating an ancient origin of these genes. We find evidence that positive selection has acted on many Schlafen genes. Moreover, our analyses indicate that a member of the Schlafen family was horizontally transferred from murine rodents to orthopoxviruses, where it is hypothesized to play a role in allowing the virus to survive host immune defense mechanisms. The functional relevance of the viral Schlafen sequences is further underscored by our finding that they are evolving under purifying selection. This is of particular importance, since orthopoxviruses infect mammals and include variola, the causative agent of smallpox, and monkeypox, an emerging virus of great concern for human health.	54	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.gene.2009.07.006	Bustos O, Naik S, Ayers G, Casola C, Perez-Lamigueiro MA, Chippindale PT, Pritham EJ, de la Casa-Esperón E.

19570875	Cowpox virus expresses a novel ankyrin repeat NF-kappaB inhibitor that controls inflammatory cell influx into virus-infected tissues and is critical for virus pathogenesis	Many pathogenic orthopoxviruses like variola virus, monkeypox virus, and cowpox virus (CPXV), but not vaccinia virus, encode a unique family of ankyrin (ANK) repeat-containing proteins that interact directly with NF-kappaB1/p105 and inhibit the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Here, we present the in vitro and in vivo characterization of the targeted gene knockout of this novel NF-kappaB inhibitor in CPXV. Our results demonstrate that the vCpx-006KO uniquely induces a variety of NF-kappaB-controlled proinflammatory cytokines from infected myeloid cells, accompanied by a rapid phosphorylation of the IkappaB kinase complex and subsequent degradation of the NF-kappaB cellular inhibitors IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB1/p105. Moreover, the vCpx-006KO virus was attenuated for virulence in mice and induced a significantly elevated cellular inflammatory process at tissue sites of virus replication in the lung. These results indicate that members of this ANK repeat family are utilized specifically by pathogenic orthopoxviruses to repress the NF-kappaB signaling pathway at tissue sites of virus replication in situ.	26	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00861-09	Mohamed MR, Rahman MM, Rice A, Moyer RW, Werden SJ, McFadden G.

14718625	Poxvirus genomes: a phylogenetic analysis	The evolutionary relationships of 26 sequenced members of the poxvirus family have been investigated by comparing their genome organization and gene content and by using DNA and protein sequences for phylogenetic analyses. The central region of the genome of chordopoxviruses (ChPVs) is highly conserved in gene content and arrangement, except for some gene inversions in Fowlpox virus (FPV) and species-specific gene insertions in FPV and Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). In the central region 90 genes are conserved in all ChPVs, but no gene from near the termini is conserved throughout the subfamily. Inclusion of two entomopoxvirus (EnPV) sequences reduces the number of conserved genes to 49. The EnPVs are divergent from ChPVs and between themselves. Relationships between ChPV genera were evaluated by comparing the genome size, number of unique genes, gene arrangement and phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences. Overall, genus Avipoxvirus is the most divergent. The next most divergent ChPV genus is Molluscipoxvirus, whose sole member, MCV, infects only man. The Suipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus genera cluster together, with Suipoxvirus and Capripoxvirus sharing a common ancestor, and are distinct from the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). Within the OPV genus, Monkeypox virus, Ectromelia virus and Cowpox virus strain Brighton Red (BR) do not group closely with any other OPV, Variola virus and Camelpox virus form a subgroup, and Vaccinia virus is most closely related to CPV-GRI-90. This suggests that CPV-BR and GRI-90 should be separate species.	134	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/vir.0.19565-0	Gubser C, Hué S, Kellam P, Smith GL.

12818626	Smallpox vaccination and bioterrorism with pox viruses	Bioterrorist attacks occupy a special place amongst the innumerable potential types of terrorist attack, with the intentional release of pox viruses being especially feared in this connection. Apart from the variola virus, the agent responsible for smallpox in humans, the monkeypox virus and numerous other animal pox viruses pose potential risks for humans and animals. This risk scenario also includes recombinations between the various pox viruses, changes in hosts and genetically engineered manipulations of pox viruses. For over 200 years, the method of choice for combatting smallpox was via vaccination with a reproductive, original vaccinia virus. Worldwide eradication of smallpox at the end of the 1970s and the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination in 1980 can be credited to such vaccination. Unfortunately, these vaccinations were associated with a large number of postvaccinal impairments, sometimes resulting in death (e.g. postvaccinal encephalitis). The only way to restrict such postvaccinal complications was to carry out initial vaccination within the first 2 postnatal years. Initial vaccination at a later age led to such a sharp increase in the number of vaccines with complications that vaccination had to be discouraged. The dilemma of the smallpox vaccine stocks stems from the fact that a large portion of these stocks are produced with the same vaccinia strains as before. This is irresponsible, especially as the percentage of immune-suppressed persons in the population, for whom vaccination-related complications pose an especial threat, is increasing. One solution to the dilemma of the smallpox vaccine stocks is the MVA strain. It is harmless, protects humans and animals equally well against smallpox and can be applied parenterally.	25	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/S0147-9571(03)00025-0	Mayr A.

3319266	Smallpox and its post-eradication surveillance	 PIP: Since May 1980 when the 33rd World Health Assembly declared the global eradication of smallpox, WHO has been developing a comprehensive system of surveillance aimed at maintaining the world permanently free from this disease. By 1984, all countries had ceased vaccinating the general public against smallpox, and had withdrawn the requirement for smallpox vaccination certificates from international travellers. A number of countries had also discontinued the vaccinating of military personnel. Until now WHO has maintained a stock of smallpox vaccine sufficient to vaccinate 300 million persons, but considering that 10 years have elapsed since the last endemic case of smallpox, maintenance of this reserve is no longer indicated. WHO continues to monitor rumors and coordinate the investigation of suspected cases, all of which have actually been misdiagnosed chickenpox or some other skin disease, or other errors in recording or reporting. Variola virus is now kept in only 2 WHO Collaborating Centers which possess high security containment laboratories. Since the variola virus gene pool has been cloned in bacterial plasmids which provide sufficient material to solve future research and diagnostic problems, there is no need to retain stocks of viable variola virus any longer. The results of a special program for the surveillance of human monkeypox have confirmed that the disease does not pose any significant health problem. In addition to testing human and animal specimens, WHO collaborating laboratories have made progress in the analysis of DNA of orthopoxviruses and in the development of reliable serological tests.	5	Review	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Jezek Z, Khodakevich LN, Wickett JF.

29934850	A many probes-one spot hybridization oligonucleotide microarray	A variant of the hybridization oligonucleotide microarray, utilizing the principle of many probes-one spot (MPOS-microarrays), is proposed. A case study based on Orthopoxviruses (Variola, Monkeypox, and Ectromelia viruses) demonstrates a considerable increase in the fluorescence signal (up to 100-fold) when several oligonucleotide probes are printed to one spot. Moreover, the specificity of detection also increases (almost 1000-fold), allowing the use of probes that individually lack such high specificity. The optimal probes have a Tm of 32-37 °C and length of 13-15 bases. We suggest that the high specificity and sensitivity of the MPOS-microarray is a result of cooperativity of DNA binding with all probes immobilized in the spot. This variant of DNA detection can be useful for designing biosensors, tools for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, microbial ecology, analysis of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and others.

26612372	Viral Skin Diseases	In the vast world of skin diseases, viral skin disorders account for a significant percentage. Most viral skin diseases present with an exanthem (skin rash) and, oftentimes, an accompanying enanthem (lesions involving the mucosal membrane). In this article, the various viral skin diseases are explored, including viral childhood exanthems (measles, rubella, erythema infectiosum, and roseola), herpes viruses (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus, viral zoonotic infections [orf, monkeypox, ebola, smallpox]), and several other viral skin diseases, such as human papilloma virus, hand, foot, and mouth disease, molluscum contagiosum, and Gianotti-Crosti syndrome.	7	Review	Enanthem; Exanthem; Latency; Self-limited; Vaccination; Viral shedding	10.1016/j.pop.2015.08.006	Ramdass P, Mullick S, Farber HF.

22297076	Pathology and viral antigen distribution following experimental infection of sheep and goats with capripoxvirus	Current understanding of capripoxvirus pathogenesis is limited since there have been no detailed studies examining cell tropism at well-defined intervals following infection. We undertook time-course studies in sheep and goats following inoculation of sheeppox or goatpox viruses in their respective homologous hosts, and examined tissues by light microscopy. A monoclonal antibody generated to a sheeppox virus core protein was used for immunohistochemical detection of viral antigen in tissue sections. Lesions and virus antigen were observed consistently in the skin, lung and lymph nodes. Antigen was detected at 6 and 8 days post inoculation for skin and lung, respectively, within cells which appeared to be of monocyte/macrophage lineage. In sheep skin capripoxvirus immunoreactivity was detected within previously unreported large multinucleated cells. In the lung, double immunolabelling detected the simultaneous expression of capripoxvirus antigen and cytokeratin indicating the presence of virus within pneumocytes. Lung double immunolabelling also detected the expression of capripoxvirus antigen in CD68(+) cells, confirming the presence of viral antigen within macrophages. Based on early detection of infected macrophages, dissemination of virus within the host and localization to tissues likely occurred through cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Histological findings revealed similarities with both monkeypox and smallpox, thus capripoxvirus infection in sheep and goats may represent useful models with which to study strategies for poxvirus-specific virus vaccine concepts and therapeutics.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jcpa.2011.12.001	Embury-Hyatt C, Babiuk S, Manning L, Ganske S, Bowden TR, Boyle DB, Copps J.

21940414	Intrabronchial inoculation of cynomolgus macaques with cowpox virus	The public health threat of orthopoxviruses from bioterrorist attacks has prompted researchers to develop suitable animal models for increasing our understanding of viral pathogenesis and evaluation of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in compliance with the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule. We present an accessible intrabronchial cowpox virus (CPXV) model that can be evaluated under biosafety level-2 laboratory conditions. In this dose-ranging study, utilizing cynomolgus macaques, signs of typical orthopoxvirus disease were observed with the lymphoid organs, liver, skin (generally mild) and respiratory tract as target tissues. Clinical and histopathological evaluation suggests that intrabronchial CPXV recapitulated many of the features of monkeypox and variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, infections in cynomolgus macaque models. These similarities suggest that CPXV infection in non-human primates should be pursued further as an alternative model of smallpox. Further development of the CPXV primate model, unimpeded by select agent and biocontainment restrictions, should facilitate the development of MCMs for smallpox.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1099/vir.0.036905-0	Smith AL, St Claire M, Yellayi S, Bollinger L, Jahrling PB, Paragas J, Blaney JE, Johnson RF.

21569797	Development of Vaccinia reporter viruses for rapid, high content analysis of viral function at all stages of gene expression	Vaccinia virus is the prototypical orthopoxvirus of Poxviridae, a family of viruses that includes the human pathogens Variola (smallpox) and Monkeypox. Core viral functions are conserved among orthopoxviruses, and consequently Vaccinia is routinely used to study poxvirus biology and screen for novel antiviral compounds. Here we describe the development of a series of fluorescent protein-based reporter Vaccinia viruses that provide unprecedented resolution for tracking viral function. The reporter viruses are divided into two sets: (1) single reporter viruses that utilize temporally regulated early, intermediate, or late viral promoters; and (2) multi-reporter viruses that utilize multiple temporally regulated promoters. Promoter and reporter combinations were chosen that yielded high signal-to-background for stage-specific viral outputs. We provide examples for how these viruses can be used in the rapid and accurate monitoring of Vaccinia function and drug action.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.04.014	Dower K, Rubins KH, Hensley LE, Connor JH.

33077299	The Brighton Collaboration standardized template for collection of key information for risk/benefit assessment of a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine platform	The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live, recombinant viral vector vaccines. The Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features specifically of the MVA-BN vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of an MVA-BN based vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus and other filovirus strains. The MVA-BN-Filo vaccine is based on a live, highly attenuated poxviral vector incapable of replicating in human cells and encodes glycoproteins of Ebola virus Zaire, Sudan virus and Marburg virus and the nucleoprotein of the Thai Forest virus. This vaccine has been approved in the European Union in July 2020 as part of a heterologous Ebola vaccination regimen. The MVA-BN vector is attenuated following over 500 serial passages in eggs, showing restricted host tropism and incompetence to replicate in human cells. MVA has six major deletions and other mutations of genes outside these deletions, which all contribute to the replication deficiency in human and other mammalian cells. Attenuation of MVA-BN was demonstrated by safe administration in immunocompromised mice and non-human primates. In multiple clinical trials with the MVA-BN backbone, more than 7800 participants have been vaccinated, demonstrating a safety profile consistent with other licensed, modern vaccines. MVA-BN has been approved as smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada in 2013, and as smallpox and monkeypox vaccine in the US in 2019. No signal for inflammatory cardiac disorders was identified throughout the MVA-BN development program. This is in sharp contrast to the older, replicating vaccinia smallpox vaccines, which have a known risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis in up to 1 in 200 vaccinees. MVA-BN-Filo as part of a heterologous Ebola vaccination regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo) has undergone clinical testing including Phase III in West Africa and is currently in use in large scale vaccination studies in Central African countries. This paper provides a comprehensive picture of the MVA-BN vector, which has reached regulatory approvals, both as MVA-BN backbone for smallpox/monkeypox, as well as for the MVA-BN-Filo construct as part of an Ebola vaccination regimen, and therefore aims to provide solutions to prevent disease from high-consequence human pathogens.	8	Review	Brighton Collaboration; Ebola vaccine; Modified Vaccinia Ankara; Risk/benefit assessment; Smallpox vaccine; Vaccine safety; Vaccines; Vaccinia; Viral vector	10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.08.050	Volkmann A, Williamson AL, Weidenthaler H, Meyer TPH, Robertson JS, Excler JL, Condit RC, Evans E, Smith ER, Kim D, Chen RT; Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group V3SWG.

32325980	Systematic Review of Important Viral Diseases in Africa in Light of the &#x27;One Health&#x27; Concept	Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases are of great public health concern. The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in China, which causes COVID-19 disease in humans, and its current spread to several countries, leading to the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus, highlights the significance of zoonotic viral diseases. Rift Valley fever, rabies, West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and influenza viruses among many other viruses have been reported from different African countries. The paucity of information, lack of knowledge, limited resources, and climate change, coupled with cultural traditions make the African continent a hotspot for vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases, which may spread globally. Currently, there is no information available on the status of virus diseases in Africa. This systematic review highlights the available information about viral diseases, including zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, reported in Africa. The findings will help us understand the trend of emerging and re-emerging virus diseases within the African continent. The findings recommend active surveillance of viral diseases and strict implementation of One Health measures in Africa to improve human public health and reduce the possibility of potential pandemics due to zoonotic viruses.	13	Information Unavailable	Africa; COVID-19; Ebola; Rift Valley fever virus; SARS-CoV-2; West Nile virus; avian influenza; coronaviruses; dengue; emerging; epidemiology; hemorrhagic fever; infectious diseases; influenza A virus; monkeypox; one health; pandemic; rabies; re-emerging; simian immunodeficiency; vector-borne; virus; zoonosis	10.3390/pathogens9040301	Chauhan RP, Dessie ZG, Noreddin A, El Zowalaty ME.

34851148	A Nucleic Acid-Based Orthopoxvirus Vaccine Targeting the Vaccinia Virus L1, A27, B5, and A33 Proteins Protects Rabbits against Lethal Rabbitpox Virus Aerosol Challenge	In the age of COVID, nucleic acid vaccines have garnered much attention, at least in part, because of the simplicity of construction, production, and flexibility to adjust and adapt to an evolving outbreak. Orthopoxviruses remain a threat on multiple fronts, especially as emerging zoonoses. In response, we developed a DNA vaccine, termed 4pox, that protected nonhuman primates against monkeypox virus (MPXV)-induced severe disease. Here, we examined the protective efficacy of the 4pox DNA vaccine delivered by intramuscular (i.m.) electroporation (EP) in rabbits challenged with aerosolized rabbitpox virus (RPXV), a model that recapitulates the respiratory route of exposure and low dose associated with natural smallpox exposure in humans. We found that 4pox-vaccinated rabbits developed immunogen-specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, and did not develop any clinical disease, indicating protection against aerosolized RPXV. In contrast, unvaccinated animals developed significant signs of disease, including lesions, and were euthanized. These findings demonstrate that an unformulated, nonadjuvanted DNA vaccine delivered i.m. can protect against an aerosol exposure. IMPORTANCE The eradication of smallpox and subsequent cessation of vaccination have left a majority of the population susceptible to variola virus or other emerging poxviruses. This is exemplified by human monkeypox, as evidenced by the increase in reported endemic and imported cases over the past decades. Therefore, a malleable vaccine technology that can be mass produced and does not require complex conditions for distribution and storage is sought. Herein, we show that a DNA vaccine, in the absence of a specialized formulation or adjuvant, can protect against a lethal aerosol insult of rabbitpox virus.

29757202	Genome Sequences of Akhmeta Virus, an Early Divergent Old World Orthopoxvirus	Annotated whole genome sequences of three isolates of the Akhmeta virus (AKMV), a novel species of orthopoxvirus (OPXV), isolated from the Akhmeta and Vani regions of the country Georgia, are presented and discussed. The AKMV genome is similar in genomic content and structure to that of the cowpox virus (CPXV), but a lower sequence identity was found between AKMV and Old World OPXVs than between other known species of Old World OPXVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AKMV diverged prior to other Old World OPXV. AKMV isolates formed a monophyletic clade in the OPXV phylogeny, yet the sequence variability between AKMV isolates was higher than between the monkeypox virus strains in the Congo basin and West Africa. An AKMV isolate from Vani contained approximately six kb sequence in the left terminal region that shared a higher similarity with CPXV than with other AKMV isolates, whereas the rest of the genome was most similar to AKMV, suggesting recombination between AKMV and CPXV in a region containing several host range and virulence genes.	11	Information Unavailable	Akhmeta virus; cowpox virus; orthopoxvirus; recombination	10.3390/v10050252	Gao J, Gigante C, Khmaladze E, Liu P, Tang S, Wilkins K, Zhao K, Davidson W, Nakazawa Y, Maghlakelidze G, Geleishvili M, Kokhreidze M, Carroll DS, Emerson G, Li Y.

24894622	Vaccinia reporter viruses for quantifying viral function at all stages of gene expression	Poxviruses are a family of double stranded DNA viruses that include active human pathogens such as monkeypox, molluscum contagiousum, and Contagalo virus. The family also includes the smallpox virus, Variola. Due to the complexity of poxvirus replication, many questions still remain regarding their gene expression strategy. In this article we describe the conceptualization and usage of recombinant vaccinia viruses that enable real-time measurement of single and multiple stages of viral gene expression in a high-throughput format. This is enabled through the use of spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins as reporters for each of three stages of viral replication. These viruses provide a high signal-to-noise ratio while retaining stage specific expression patterns, enabling plate-based assays and microscopic observations of virus propagation and replication. These tools have uses for antiviral discovery, studies of the virus-host interaction, and evolutionary biology.	4	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3791/51522	Rozelle DK, Filone CM, Dower K, Connor JH.

17040245	Zoonotic viral diseases and the frontier of early diagnosis, control and prevention	Public awareness of the human health risks of zoonotic infections has grown in recent years. Currently, concern of H5N1 flu transmission from migratory bird populations has increased with foci of fatal human cases. This comes on the heels of other major zoonotic viral epidemics in the last decade. These include other acute emerging or re-emerging viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West-Nile virus, Ebola virus, monkeypox, as well as the more inapparent insidious slow viral and prion diseases. Virus infections with zoonotic potential can become serious killers once they are able to establish the necessary adaptations for efficient human-to-human transmission under circumstances sufficient to reach epidemic proportions. The monitoring and early diagnosis of these potential risks are overlapping frontiers of human and veterinary medicine. Here, current viral zoonotics and evolving threats are reviewed.	19	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.1365-2796.2006.01711.x	Heeney JL.

26556597	Comparison of the Cowpox Virus and Vaccinia Virus Mature Virion Proteome: Analysis of the Species- and Strain-Specific Proteome	Cowpox virus (CPXV) causes most zoonotic orthopoxvirus (OPV) infections in Europe and Northern as well as Central Asia. The virus has the broadest host range of OPV and is transmitted to humans from rodents and other wild or domestic animals. Increasing numbers of human CPXV infections in a population with declining immunity have raised concerns about the virus' zoonotic potential. While there have been reports on the proteome of other human-pathogenic OPV, namely vaccinia virus (VACV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV), the protein composition of the CPXV mature virion (MV) is unknown. This study focused on the comparative analysis of the VACV and CPXV MV proteome by label-free single-run proteomics using nano liquid chromatography and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). The presented data reveal that the common VACV and CPXV MV proteome contains most of the known conserved and essential OPV proteins and is associated with cellular proteins known to be essential for viral replication. While the species-specific proteome could be linked mainly to less genetically-conserved gene products, the strain-specific protein abundance was found to be of high variance in proteins associated with entry, host-virus interaction and protein processing.	12	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0141527	Doellinger J, Schaade L, Nitsche A.

20659521	Diazepam leads to enhanced severity of orthopoxvirus infection and immune suppression	Benzodiazepines are drugs widely used as tranquilizers and in various other indications. We treated Balb/c mice with diazepam and infected them with cowpox (CPXV) and vaccinia virus (VACV). Disease index, weight loss and the antibody response were determined. Additionally the influence of different benzodiazepines on the mitogen response of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen cells was tested. Diazepam led to earlier disease onset, prolonged duration of symptoms, higher weight loss and overall disease index in VACV infected mice. CPXV infected mice developed poxviral skin lesions only after drug administration and a significant decrease in the specific antibody response was also observed. Diazepam and alprazolam also inhibited the proliferative response of human lymphocytes/spleen cells in vitro but did not show noteworthy apoptotic effects. It is surprising that even a single dose of diazepam has a profound influence on the immune system, sufficient to facilitate symptomatic infectious disease. These data provide first evidence that commonly used drugs like Valium may augment severity of rare poxvirus infections such as CPXV or monkeypox. As VACV is still used as life vaccine against smallpox there is also a risk of enhanced side effects or possible interference with the success of vaccination.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.07.032	Huemer HP, Lassnig C, Nowotny N, Irschick EU, Kitchen M, Pavlic M.

18725245	Dual-probe real-time PCR assay for detection of variola or other orthopoxviruses with dried reagents	A real-time, multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on dried PCR reagents was developed. Only variola virus could be specifically detected by a FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)-labeled probe while camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia viruses could be detected by a TET (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)-labeled probe in a single PCR reaction. Approximately 25 copies of cloned variola virus DNA and 50 copies of genomic orthopoxviruses DNA could be detected with high reproducibility. The assay exhibited a dynamic range of seven orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient value greater than 0.97. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay, as determined from 100 samples that contained nucleic acids from a multitude of bacterial and viral species were 96% and 98%, respectively. The limit of detection, sensitivity and specificity of the assay were comparable to standard real-time PCR assays with wet reagents. Employing a multiplexed format in this assay allows simultaneous discrimination of the variola virus from other closely related orthopoxviruses. Furthermore, the implementation of dried reagents in real-time PCR assays is an important step towards simplifying such assays and allowing their use in areas where cold storage is not easily accessible.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.07.018	Aitichou M, Saleh S, Kyusung P, Huggins J, O'Guinn M, Jahrling P, Ibrahim S.

17923850	Correlates of protective immunity in poxvirus infection: where does antibody stand?	Even though smallpox has been eradicated, the threat of accidental or intentional release has highlighted the fact there is little consensus about correlates of protective immunity or immunity against re-infection with the causative poxvirus, variola virus (VARV). As the existing vaccine for smallpox has unacceptable rates of side effects and complications, new vaccines are urgently needed. Surrogate animal models of VARV infection in humans, including vaccinia virus (VACV) and ectromelia virus (ECTV) infection in mice, monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection in macaques have been used as tools to dissect the immune response to poxviruses. Mousepox, caused by ECTV, a natural mouse pathogen, is arguably the best surrogate small-animal model, as it shares many aspects of virus biology, pathology and clinical features with smallpox in humans. The requirements for recovery from a primary ECTV infection have been well characterized and include type I and II interferons, natural killer cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cell effector function and antibody. From a vaccine standpoint, it is imperative that the requirements for recovery from secondary infection are also identified. We have investigated host immune parameters in response to a secondary ECTV infection, and have identified that interferon and CD8T cell effector functions are not essential; however, T- and B-cell interaction and antibody are absolutely critical for recovery from a secondary challenge. The central role of antibody has been also been identified in the secondary response to other poxviruses. These findings have important clinical implications and would greatly assist the design of therapeutic interventions and new vaccines for smallpox.	42	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1038/sj.icb.7100118	Panchanathan V, Chaudhri G, Karupiah G.

15334537	Therapeutic potential of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues against poxvirus infections	Several nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been identified as potent antiviral agents with convincing activity against poxviruses (including variola, vaccinia, monkeypox, cowpox, molluscum contagiosum, orf). Among the nucleoside analogues, 8-methyladenosine and 2-amino-7-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]purine (S2242), have been identified as promising anti-poxvirus agents. Among the nucleotide analogues, (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine [(S)-HPMPC, cidofovir], (S)-9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine [(S)-HPMPDAP] and (S)-6-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)oxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine [(S)-HPMPO-DAPy] have been identified as promising anti-poxvirus agents. These nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proved to be efficacious in various animal models for poxvirus infections. Only one compound, cidofovir, has also proved efficacious against poxvirus infections in humans, i.e. molluscum contagiosum and orf (sheep pox). Cidofovir is formally licensed for clinical use (intravenous administration for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients); however, it could also be formulated for topical administration, or for oral administration in prodrug form, i.e. as 1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir.	19	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1002/rmv.439	De Clercq E, Neyts J.

15196818	Cutaneous infections of mice with vaccinia or cowpox viruses and efficacy of cidofovir	Orthopoxviruses, including smallpox, monkeypox and molluscipox, pose risks to human health through bioterrorist acts or natural transmission. There is no approved therapy for orthopoxvirus infections; however, cidofovir (CDV) has been approved as an investigational new drug for emergency treatment of adverse effects following smallpox vaccination. For evaluation of new therapies directed against orthopoxvirus infections, we have utilized immunocompetent, hairless mice (SKH-1) inoculated by a cutaneous route with cowpox virus (CV) or vaccinia virus (VV). Mice subsequently developed skin lesions and virus was recovered from the site of inoculation and quantified. Skin biopsies were evaluated microscopically, revealing brick-like eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies characteristic of orthopoxvirus infection. SKH-1 mice fully recovered from either CV or VV infection. Immunodeficient Athymic or Rhino mice inoculated with CV or VV had more lesions and severe disease than SKH-1 mice. CV-infected SKH-1 mice were treated either with systemic or topical CDV. Although some protection was achieved with systemic treatment, 5% topical CDV was most effective at reducing virus titers in skin, lung, kidney, and spleen. These models may provide a means for evaluating efficacy of new therapies directed against orthopoxvirus diseases and further confirm the topical activity of CDV against cutaneous infections.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.antiviral.2004.02.003	Quenelle DC, Collins DJ, Kern ER.

12951214	Detection and discrimination of orthopoxviruses using microarrays of immobilized oligonucleotides	Variola virus (VARV), causing smallpox, is a potential biological weapon. Methods to detect VARV rapidly and to differentiate it from other viruses causing similar clinical syndromes are needed urgently. We have developed a new microarray-based method that detects simultaneously and discriminates four orthopoxvirus (OPV) species pathogenic for humans (variola, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses) and distinguishes them from chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus or VZV). The OPV gene C23L/B29R, encoding the CC-chemokine binding protein, was sequenced for 41 strains of seven species of orthopox viruses obtained from different geographical regions. Those C23L/B29R sequences and the ORF 62 sequences from 13 strains of VZV (selected from GenBank) were used to design oligonucleotide probes that were immobilized on an aldehyde-coated glass surface (a total of 57 probes). The microchip contained several unique 13-21 bases long oligonucleotide probes specific to each virus species to ensure redundancy and robustness of the assay. A region approximately 1100 bases long was amplified from samples of viral DNA and fluorescently labeled with Cy5-modified dNTPs, and single-stranded DNA was prepared by strand separation. Hybridization was carried out under plastic coverslips, resulting in a fluorescent pattern that was quantified using a confocal laser scanner. 49 known and blinded samples of OPV DNA, representing different OPV species, and two VZV strains were tested. The oligonucleotide microarray hybridization technique identified reliably and correctly all samples. This new procedure takes only 3 h, and it can be used for parallel testing of multiple samples.	19	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0166-0934(03)00193-9	Laassri M, Chizhikov V, Mikheev M, Shchelkunov S, Chumakov K.

29155663	Frameworks for Preventing, Detecting, and Controlling Zoonotic Diseases	Preventing zoonotic diseases requires coordinated actions by government authorities responsible for human and animal health. Constructing the frameworks needed to foster intersectoral collaboration can be approached in many ways. We highlight 3 examples of approaches to implement zoonotic disease prevention and control programs. The first, rabies control in Ethiopia, was implemented using an umbrella approach: a comprehensive program designed for accelerated impact. The second, a monkeypox program in Democratic Republic of the Congo, was implemented in a stepwise manner, whereby incremental improvements and activities were incorporated into the program. The third approach, a pathogen discovery program, applied in the country of Georgia, was designed to characterize and understand the ecology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of a new zoonotic pathogen. No one approach is superior, but various factors should be taken into account during design, planning, and implementation.	3	Information Unavailable	Democratic Republic of the Congo; Ethiopia; Republic of Georgia; United States; global health security; prevention and control; program design; public health program implementation; zoonoses	10.3201/eid2313.170601	Shiferaw ML, Doty JB, Maghlakelidze G, Morgan J, Khmaladze E, Parkadze O, Donduashvili M, Wemakoy EO, Muyembe JJ, Mulumba L, Malekani J, Kabamba J, Kanter T, Boulanger LL, Haile A, Bekele A, Bekele M, Tafese K, McCollum AA, Reynolds MG.

26605344	EPIPOX: Immunoinformatic Characterization of the Shared T-Cell Epitome between Variola Virus and Related Pathogenic Orthopoxviruses	Concerns that variola viruses might be used as bioweapons have renewed the interest in developing new and safer smallpox vaccines. Variola virus genomes are now widely available, allowing computational characterization of the entire T-cell epitome and the use of such information to develop safe and yet effective vaccines. To this end, we identified 124 proteins shared between various species of pathogenic orthopoxviruses including variola minor and major, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses, and we targeted them for T-cell epitope prediction. We recognized 8,106, and 8,483 unique class I and class II MHC-restricted T-cell epitopes that are shared by all mentioned orthopoxviruses. Subsequently, we developed an immunological resource, EPIPOX, upon the predicted T-cell epitome. EPIPOX is freely available online and it has been designed to facilitate reverse vaccinology. Thus, EPIPOX includes key epitope-focused protein annotations: time point expression, presence of leader and transmembrane signals, and known location on outer membrane structures of the infective viruses. These features can be used to select specific T-cell epitopes suitable for experimental validation restricted by single MHC alleles, as combinations thereof, or by MHC supertypes.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1155/2015/738020	Molero-Abraham M, Glutting JP, Flower DR, Lafuente EM, Reche PA.

20454688	A novel highly reproducible and lethal nonhuman primate model for orthopox virus infection	The intentional re-introduction of Variola virus (VARV), the agent of smallpox, into the human population is of great concern due its bio-terroristic potential. Moreover, zoonotic infections with Cowpox (CPXV) and Monkeypox virus (MPXV) cause severe diseases in humans. Smallpox vaccines presently available can have severe adverse effects that are no longer acceptable. The efficacy and safety of new vaccines and antiviral drugs for use in humans can only be demonstrated in animal models. The existing nonhuman primate models, using VARV and MPXV, need very high viral doses that have to be applied intravenously or intratracheally to induce a lethal infection in macaques. To overcome these drawbacks, the infectivity and pathogenicity of a particular CPXV was evaluated in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).A CPXV named calpox virus was isolated from a lethal orthopox virus (OPV) outbreak in New World monkeys. We demonstrated that marmosets infected with calpox virus, not only via the intravenous but also the intranasal route, reproducibly develop symptoms resembling smallpox in humans. Infected animals died within 1-3 days after onset of symptoms, even when very low infectious viral doses of 5x10(2) pfu were applied intranasally. Infectious virus was demonstrated in blood, saliva and all organs analyzed.We present the first characterization of a new OPV infection model inducing a disease in common marmosets comparable to smallpox in humans. Intranasal virus inoculation mimicking the natural route of smallpox infection led to reproducible infection. In vivo titration resulted in an MID(50) (minimal monkey infectious dose 50%) of 8.3x10(2) pfu of calpox virus which is approximately 10,000-fold lower than MPXV and VARV doses applied in the macaque models. Therefore, the calpox virus/marmoset model is a suitable nonhuman primate model for the validation of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Furthermore, this model can help study mechanisms of OPV pathogenesis.	27	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0010412	Kramski M, Mätz-Rensing K, Stahl-Hennig C, Kaup FJ, Nitsche A, Pauli G, Ellerbrok H.

28727764	Vaccinia virus and Cowpox virus are not susceptible to the interferon-induced antiviral protein MxA	MxA protein is expressed in response to type I and type III Interferon and constitute an important antiviral factor with broad antiviral activity to diverse RNA viruses. In addition, some studies expand the range of MxA antiviral activity to include particular DNA viruses like Monkeypox virus (MPXV) and African Swine Fever virus (ASFV). However, a broad profile of activity of MxA to large DNA viruses has not been established to date. Here, we investigated if some well characterized DNA viruses belonging to the Poxviridae family are sensitive to human MxA. A cell line inducibly expressing MxA to inhibitory levels showed no anti-Vaccinia virus (VACV) virus activity, indicating either lack of susceptibility of the virus, or the existence of viral factors capable of counteracting MxA inhibition. To determine if VACV resistance to MxA was due to a virus-encoded anti-MxA activity, we performed coinfections of VACV and the MxA-sensitive Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV), and show that VACV does not protect VSV from MxA inhibition in trans. Those results were extended to several VACV strains and two CPXV strains, thus confirming that those Orthopoxviruses do not block MxA action. Overall, these results point to a lack of susceptibility of the Poxviridae to MxA antiviral activity.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0181459	Lorenzo MM, Sanchez-Puig JM, Blasco R.

17988703	Capripoxvirus tissue tropism and shedding: A quantitative study in experimentally infected sheep and goats	Sheeppox virus and goatpox virus cause systemic disease in sheep and goats that is often associated with high morbidity and high mortality. To increase understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, we undertook quantitative time-course studies in sheep and goats following intradermal inoculation of Nigerian sheeppox virus or Indian goatpox virus in their respective homologous hosts. Viremia, determined by virus isolation and real-time PCR, cleared within 2 to 3 weeks post inoculation. Peak shedding of viral DNA and infectious virus in nasal, conjunctival and oral secretions occurred between 10 and 14 days post inoculation, and persisted at low levels for up to an additional 3 to 6 weeks. Although gross lesions developed in multiple organ systems, highest viral titers were detected in skin and in discrete sites within oronasal tissues and gastrointestinal tract. The temporal distribution of infectious virus and viral DNA in tissues suggests an underlying pathogenesis that is similar to smallpox and monkeypox where greatest viral replication occurs in the skin. Our data demonstrate that capripoxvirus infections in sheep and goats provide additional and convenient models which are suitable not only for evaluation of poxvirus-specific vaccine concepts and therapeutics, but also study of poxvirus-host interactions.	65	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2007.10.002	Bowden TR, Babiuk SL, Parkyn GR, Copps JS, Boyle DB.

17632198	Tropism of Tanapox virus infection in primary human cells	Tanapox virus (TPV) belongs to the genus Yatapoxvirus and causes a relatively benign zoonotic disease in man, with symptoms that resemble a mild version of human monkeypox. In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms of TPV pathogenesis, the tropism and replication characteristics of TPV were examined in a variety of primary human cells. A GFP expressing TPV (TPV-GFP) was constructed and used to infect primary human dermal fibroblasts (pHDFs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), both of which are believed to be major in vivo targets of poxvirus infection. pHDFs fully supported productive replication and cell-cell spread of TPV-GFP. However, induction of cell cycle arrest in pHDFs by contact mediated inhibition or rapamycin treatment eliminated the ability of TPV to fully stimulate cell cycle progression and dramatically reduced viral replication. TPV-GFP-infected human PBMCs were screened for permissiveness by FACS analysis. CD14+ cells (monocytes) were the primary cellular target for TPV infection. A small proportion of CD3+ cells (T cells) were positive for GFP expression, yet TPV was not able to replicate and spread in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes, regardless of their state of activation. Primary human monocytes, however, demonstrated robust TPV replication, yet these cells no longer supported replication of TPV once they differentiated into macrophages. This unique ex vivo tropism of TPV gives key insights into the basis for the self-limiting pathogenicity of TPV in man.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2007.06.019	Nazarian SH, Barrett JW, Stanford MM, Johnston JB, Essani K, McFadden G.

3023681	Identification and nucleotide sequence of the thymidine kinase gene of Shope fibroma virus	The thymidine kinase (TK) gene of Shope fibroma virus (SFV), a tumorigenic leporipoxvirus, was localized within the viral genome with degenerate oligonucleotide probes. These probes were constructed to two regions of high sequence conservation between the vaccinia virus TK gene and those of several known eucaryotic cellular TK genes, including human, mouse, hamster, and chicken TK genes. The oligonucleotide probes initially localized the SFV TK gene 50 kilobases (kb) from the right terminus of the 160-kb SFV genome within the 9.5-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment E. Fine-mapping analysis indicated that the TK gene was within a 1.2-kb AvaI-HaeIII fragment, and DNA sequencing of this region revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 176 amino acids possessing considerable homology to the TK genes of the vaccinia, variola, and monkeypox orthopoxviruses and also to a variety of cellular TK genes. Homology matrix analysis and homology scores suggest that the SFV TK gene has diverged significantly from its counterpart members in the orthopoxvirus genus. Nevertheless, the presence of conserved upstream open reading frames on the 5' side of all of the poxvirus TK genes indicates a similarity of functional organization between the orthopoxviruses and leporipoxviruses. These data suggest a common ancestral origin for at least some of the unique internal regions of the leporipoxviruses and orthopoxviruses as exemplified by SFV and vaccinia virus, respectively.	14	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.60.3.920-927.1986	Upton C, McFadden G.

31828053	Infectious Disease Risk Across the Growing Human-Non Human Primate Interface: A Review of the Evidence	Most of the human pandemics reported to date can be classified as zoonoses. Among these, there is a long history of infectious diseases that have spread from non-human primates (NHP) to humans. For millennia, indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival were exposed to the risk of NHP pathogens' transmission through animal hunting and wild meat consumption. Usually, exposure is of no consequence or is limited to mild infections. In rare situations, it can be more severe or even become a real public health concern. Since the emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), nobody can ignore that an emerging infectious diseases (EID) might spread from NHP into the human population. In large parts of Central Africa and Asia, wildlife remains the primary source of meat and income for millions of people living in rural areas. However, in the past few decades the risk of exposure to an NHP pathogen has taken on a new dimension. Unprecedented breaking down of natural barriers between NHP and humans has increased exposure to health risks for a much larger population, including people living in urban areas. There are several reasons for this: (i) due to road development and massive destruction of ecosystems for agricultural needs, wildlife and humans come into contact more frequently; (ii) due to ecological awareness, many long distance travelers are in search of wildlife discovery, with a particular fascination for African great apes; (iii) due to the attraction for ancient temples and mystical practices, others travelers visit Asian places colonized by NHP. In each case, there is a risk of pathogen transmission through a bite or another route of infection. Beside the individual risk of contracting a pathogen, there is also the possibility of starting a new pandemic. This article reviews the known cases of NHP pathogens' transmission to humans whether they are hunters, travelers, ecotourists, veterinarians, or scientists working on NHP. Although pathogen transmission is supposed to be a rare outcome, Rabies virus, Herpes B virus, Monkeypox virus, Ebola virus, or Yellow fever virus infections are of greater concern and require quick countermeasures from public health professionals.	25	Review	emerging disease; interspecies adaptation; monkey alarm calls; threat; zoonoses	10.3389/fpubh.2019.00305	Devaux CA, Mediannikov O, Medkour H, Raoult D.

24312452	Genome-wide comparison of cowpox viruses reveals a new clade related to Variola virus	Zoonotic infections caused by several orthopoxviruses (OPV) like monkeypox virus or vaccinia virus have a significant impact on human health. In Europe, the number of diagnosed infections with cowpox viruses (CPXV) is increasing in animals as well as in humans. CPXV used to be enzootic in cattle; however, such infections were not being diagnosed over the last decades. Instead, individual cases of cowpox are being found in cats or exotic zoo animals that transmit the infection to humans. Both animals and humans reveal local exanthema on arms and legs or on the face. Although cowpox is generally regarded as a self-limiting disease, immunosuppressed patients can develop a lethal systemic disease resembling smallpox. To date, only limited information on the complex and, compared to other OPV, sparsely conserved CPXV genomes is available. Since CPXV displays the widest host range of all OPV known, it seems important to comprehend the genetic repertoire of CPXV which in turn may help elucidate specific mechanisms of CPXV pathogenesis and origin. Therefore, 22 genomes of independent CPXV strains from clinical cases, involving ten humans, four rats, two cats, two jaguarundis, one beaver, one elephant, one marah and one mongoose, were sequenced by using massive parallel pyrosequencing. The extensive phylogenetic analysis showed that the CPXV strains sequenced clearly cluster into several distinct clades, some of which are closely related to Vaccinia viruses while others represent different clades in a CPXV cluster. Particularly one CPXV clade is more closely related to Camelpox virus, Taterapox virus and Variola virus than to any other known OPV. These results support and extend recent data from other groups who postulate that CPXV does not form a monophyletic clade and should be divided into multiple lineages.	31	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0079953	Dabrowski PW, Radonić A, Kurth A, Nitsche A.

22205744	Identification of a pyridopyrimidinone inhibitor of orthopoxviruses from a diversity-oriented synthesis library	Orthopoxviruses include the prototypical vaccinia virus, the emerging infectious agent monkeypox virus, and the potential biothreat variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox). There is currently no FDA-approved drug for humans infected with orthopoxviruses. We screened a diversity-oriented synthesis library for new scaffolds with activity against vaccinia virus. This screen identified a nonnucleoside analog that blocked postreplicative intermediate and late gene expression. Viral genome replication was unaffected, and inhibition could be elicited late in infection and persisted upon drug removal. Sequencing of drug-resistant viruses revealed mutations predicted to be on the periphery of the highly conserved viral RNA polymerase large subunit. Consistent with this, the compound had broad-spectrum activity against orthopoxviruses in vitro. These findings indicate that novel chemical synthesis approaches are a potential source for new infectious disease therapeutics and identify a potentially promising candidate for development to treat orthopoxvirus-infected individuals.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.05416-11	Dower K, Filone CM, Hodges EN, Bjornson ZB, Rubins KH, Brown LE, Schaus S, Hensley LE, Connor JH.

22114343	Sequence-divergent chordopoxvirus homologs of the o3 protein maintain functional interactions with components of the vaccinia virus entry-fusion complex	Composed of 35 amino acids, O3 is the smallest characterized protein encoded by vaccinia virus (VACV) and is an integral component of the entry-fusion complex (EFC). O3 is conserved with 100% identity in all orthopoxviruses except for monkeypox viruses, whose O3 homologs have 2 to 3 amino acid substitutions. Since O3 is part of the EFC, high conservation could suggest an immutable requirement for interaction with multiple proteins. Chordopoxviruses of other genera also encode small proteins with a characteristic predicted N-terminal α-helical hydrophobic domain followed by basic amino acids and proline in the same relative genome location as that of VACV O3. However, the statistical significance of their similarity to VACV O3 is low due to the large contribution of the transmembrane domain, their small size, and their sequence diversity. Nevertheless, trans-complementation experiments demonstrated the ability of a representative O3-like protein from each chordopoxvirus genus to rescue the infectivity of a VACV mutant that was unable to express endogenous O3. Moreover, recombinant viruses expressing O3 homologs in place of O3 replicated and formed plaques as well or nearly as well as wild-type VACV. The O3 homologs expressed by the recombinant VACVs were incorporated into the membranes of mature virions and, with one exception, remained stably associated with the detergent-extracted and affinity-purified EFC. The ability of the sequence-divergent O3 homologs to coordinate function with VACV entry proteins suggests the conservation of structural motifs. Analysis of chimeras formed by swapping domains of O3 with those of other proteins indicated that the N-terminal transmembrane segment was responsible for EFC interactions and for the complementation of infectivity.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.06069-11	Satheshkumar PS, Moss B.

32986741	Attitudes, practices, and zoonoses awareness of community members involved in the bushmeat trade near Murchison Falls National Park, northern Uganda	The harvest of bushmeat is widespread in the tropics and sub-tropics. Often in these communities, there is a dependence on bushmeat for both food security and basic income. Despite the importance of bushmeat for households worldwide, the practice raises concern for transmission of zoonotic pathogens through hunting, food preparation, and consumption. In Uganda, harvest of wildlife is illegal, but bushmeat hunting, is commonplace. We interviewed 292 women who cook for their households and 180 self-identified hunters from 21 villages bordering Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda to gain insights into bushmeat preferences, opportunity for zoonotic pathogen transmission, and awareness of common wildlife-associated zoonoses. Both hunters and women who cook considered primates to be the most likely wildlife species to carry diseases humans can catch. Among common zoonotic pathogens, the greatest proportions of women who cook and hunters believed that pathogens causing stomach ache or diarrhea and monkeypox can be transmitted by wildlife. Neither women who cook nor hunters report being frequently injury during cooking, butchering, or hunting, and few report taking precautions while handling bushmeat. The majority of women who cook believe that hunters and dealers never or rarely disguise primate meat as another kind of meat in market, while the majority of hunters report that they usually disguise primate meat as another kind of meat. These data play a crucial role in our understanding of potential for exposure to and infection with zoonotic pathogens in the bushmeat trade. Expanding our knowledge of awareness, perceptions and risks enables us to identify opportunities to mitigate infections and injury risk and promote safe handling practices.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0239599	Dell BM, Souza MJ, Willcox AS.

23147561	Human CD4 T cell epitopes selective for Vaccinia versus Variola virus	Due to the high degree of sequence identity between Orthopoxvirus species, the specific B and T cell responses raised against these viruses are largely cross-reactive and poorly selective. We therefore searched for CD4 T cell epitopes present in the conserved parts of the Vaccinia genome (VACV) but absent from Variola viruses (VARV), with a view to identifying immunogenic sequences selective for VACV. We identified three long peptide fragments from the B7R, B10R and E7R proteins by in silico comparisons of the poxvirus genomes, and evaluated the recognition of these fragments by VACV-specific T cell lines derived from healthy donors. For the 12 CD4 T cell epitopes identified, we assessed their binding to common HLA-DR allotypes and their capacity to induce peptide-specific CD4 T-cell lines. Four peptides from B7R and B10R displayed a broad binding specificity for HLA-DR molecules and induced multiple T cell lines from healthy donors. Besides their absence from VARV, the two B10R peptide sequences were mutated in the Cowpox virus and completely absent from the Monkeypox genome. This work contributes to the development of differential diagnosis of poxvirus infections.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.molimm.2012.10.011	Probst A, Besse A, Favry E, Imbert G, Tanchou V, Castelli FA, Maillere B.

22229039	Immune modulation in primary vaccinia virus zoonotic human infections	In 2010, the WHO celebrated the 30th anniversary of the smallpox eradication. Ironically, infections caused by viruses related to smallpox are being increasingly reported worldwide, including Monkeypox, Cowpox, and Vaccinia virus (VACV). Little is known about the human immunological responses elicited during acute infections caused by orthopoxviruses. We have followed VACV zoonotic outbreaks taking place in Brazil and analyzed cellular immune responses in patients acutely infected by VACV. Results indicated that these patients show a biased immune modulation when compared to noninfected controls. Amounts of B cells are low and less activated in infected patients. Although present, T CD4(+) cells are also less activated when compared to noninfected individuals, and so are monocytes/macrophages. Similar results were obtained when Balb/C mice were experimentally infected with a VACV sample isolated during the zoonotic outbreaks. Taking together, the data suggest that zoonotic VACVs modulate specific immune cell compartments during an acute infection in humans.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1155/2012/974067	Silva Gomes JA, de Araújo FF, de Souza Trindade G, Quinan BR, Drumond BP, Ferreira JM, Mota BE, Nogueira ML, Kroon EG, Santos Abrahão J, Côrrea-Oliveira R, da Fonseca FG.

21964238	The neutralizing human recombinant antibodies to pathogenic Orthopoxviruses derived from a phage display immune library	A panel of recombinant human antibodies to orthopoxviruses was isolated from a combinatorial phage display library of human scFv antibodies constructed from the Vh and Vl genes cloned from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of Vaccinia virus (VACV) immune donors. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests showed that seven selected phage-displaying scFv antibodies (pdAbs) neutralized both CPXV and VACV, and five of them neutralized Monkeypox virus (MPXV). Western blot analysis of VACV and CPXV proteins demonstrated that seven neutralizing antibodies recognized a 35 kDa protein. To identify this target protein, we produced a recombinant J3L protein of CPXV and showed that all the selected neutralizing antibodies recognized this protein. Neutralizing pdAb b9 was converted into fully human mAb b9 (fh b9), and scFv b9 displayed high binding affinities (K(d) of 0.7 and 3.2 nM). The fh b9 reduced VACV plaque formation in a dose-dependent manner.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virusres.2011.09.008	Tikunova N, Dubrovskaya V, Morozova V, Yun T, Khlusevich Y, Bormotov N, Laman A, Brovko F, Shvalov A, Belanov E.

32759969	Heterotypic immunity against vaccinia virus in an HLA-B*07:02 transgenic mousepox infection model	Vaccination with vaccinia virus (VACV) elicits heterotypic immunity to smallpox, monkeypox, and mousepox, the mechanistic basis for which is poorly understood. It is generally assumed that heterotypic immunity arises from the presentation of a wide array of VACV-derived, CD8+ T cell epitopes that share homology with other poxviruses. Herein this assumption was tested using a large panel of VACV-derived peptides presented by HLA-B*07:02 (B7.2) molecules in a mousepox/ectromelia virus (ECTV)-infection, B7.2 transgenic mouse model. Most dominant epitopes recognized by ECTV- and VACV-reactive CD8+ T cells overlapped significantly without altering immunodominance hierarchy. Further, several epitopes recognized by ECTV-reactive CD8+ T cells were not recognized by VACV-reactive CD8+ T cells, and vice versa. In one instance, the lack of recognition owed to a N72K variation in the ECTV C4R70-78 variant of the dominant VACV B8R70-78 epitope. C4R70-78 does not bind to B7.2 and, hence, it was neither immunogenic nor antigenic. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for VACV vaccination-induced heterotypic immunity which can protect against Variola and Monkeypox disease. The understanding of how cross-reactive responses develop is essential for the rational design of a subunit-based vaccine that would be safe, and effectively protect against heterologous infection.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/s41598-020-69897-w	Kumar A, Suryadevara NC, Wolf KJ, Wilson JT, Di Paolo RJ, Brien JD, Joyce S.

24606683	Elimination of A-type inclusion formation enhances cowpox virus replication in mice: implications for orthopoxvirus evolution	Some orthopoxviruses including cowpox virus embed virus particles in dense bodies, comprised of the A-type inclusion (ATI) protein, which may provide long-term environmental protection. This strategy could be beneficial if the host population is sparse or spread is inefficient or indirect. However, the formation of ATI may be neutral or disadvantageous for orthopoxviruses that rely on direct respiratory spread. Disrupted ATI open reading frames in orthopoxviruses such as variola virus, the agent of smallpox, and monkeypox virus suggests that loss of this feature provided positive selection. To test this hypothesis, we constructed cowpox virus mutants with deletion of the ATI gene or another gene required for embedding virions. The ATI deletion mutant caused greater weight loss and higher replication in the respiratory tract than control viruses, supporting our hypothesis. Deletion of the gene for embedding virions had a lesser effect, possibly due to known additional functions of the encoded protein.	9	Information Unavailable	Cowpox virus inclusions; Poxvirus pathogenicity; Respiratory virus infection	10.1016/j.virol.2013.12.030	Kastenmayer RJ, Maruri-Avidal L, Americo JL, Earl PL, Weisberg AS, Moss B.

17157663	Smallpox vaccines: Past, present, and future	The global eradication of smallpox was a tremendous achievement made possible by the development of an effective vaccine. Routine vaccination of the general population is no longer recommended. However, stocks of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, still exist in 2 secure laboratories, and permanent disposal has been controversial. In addition, there is speculation that variola virus may exist outside of these 2 facilities, and there is a concern that the threat of smallpox will be used as a bioterrorist weapon. In 2002, this concern led to a vaccination campaign in US military and civilian healthcare workers and first responders. Although the historical live virus vaccine has proven efficacy, it also is associated with serious adverse events and rare fatal reactions, particularly in the setting of immunodeficiency and atopic eczema. In addition, this vaccine was historically produced using animal intermediaries in a process that was prone to contamination and not acceptable for current manufacturing standards. Development of alternative poxvirus vaccines is focused on replication-defective viruses, gene-based vectors, and subunit approaches to improve safety and immunogenicity. The conundrum is that in the absence of an intentional release of variola, efficacy evaluation of new candidate vaccines will be limited to animal model testing, which creates new challenges for the vaccine licensure process. Although motivated by the threat of bioterrorism, the hope is for new poxvirus vaccines to have their greatest utility against other pathogenic orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox and for the development of recombinant poxvirus-based vectors to treat and prevent other diseases.	38	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.jaci.2006.09.037	Parrino J, Graham BS.

16927285	Microarray assay for detection and discrimination of Orthopoxvirus species	A microarray method was developed for simultaneous detection and identification of six species of Orthopoxvirus (OPV) including Variola, Monkeypox, Cowpox, Camelpox, Vaccinia, and Ectromelia viruses. The method allowed us to discriminate OPV species from varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Herpes Simplex 1 virus (HSV-1), and Herpes Simplex 2 virus (HSV-2) that cause infections with clinical manifestations similar to OPV infections. The nucleotide sequences of the C23L/B29R and the B19R genes identified for 86 and 72 different OPV strains, respectively, were used to design species-specific microarray oligonucleotide probes (oligoprobes). The microarray also contained several oligoprobes selected from the ORF31, US4, and US5 genes of VZV, HSV-1, and HSV-2, respectively. The samples (from HSVs or OPVs) of ssDNAs for analyses were prepared by using asymmetric PCR followed by chemical labeling of ssDNA with Cy3 dye. DNA from 52 samples of various OPV species, two isolates of VZV, two of HSV-1, and three of HSV-2 were tested using the developed microarray assay; all tested viruses were accurately identified. To ensure the robustness of the microarray assay, three additional unrelated variola virus strains with unknown sequences of the C23L/B29R and the B19R genes were tested. In each instance the microarray unambiguously identified them as Variola virus species. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that this new microarray method is a valuable tool for the rapid and accurate detection and differentiation of these important viral pathogens.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.20698	Ryabinin VA, Shundrin LA, Kostina EB, Laassri M, Chizhikov V, Shchelkunov SN, Chumakov K, Sinyakov AN.

33448254	Superspreaders: A Lurking Danger in the Community	"A ""superspreader"" refers to an unusually contagious organism infected with a disease. With respect to a human borne illnesses, a superspreader is someone who is more likely to infect other humans when compared to a typically infected person. The existence of human superspreaders is deeply entrenched in history; the most famous case being that of Typhoid Mary. Through contact tracing, epidemiologists have identified human superspreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and SARS. The recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has shifted the focus back on the superspreaders. We herein present a case report of a COVID-19 superspreader with a hitherto unusually high number of infected contacts. The index case was a 33 year old male who resided in a low income settlement comprising of rehabilitated slum dwellers and worked as a healthcare worker (HCW) in a tertiary care hospital and had tested positive for COVID-19.On contact tracing, he had a total of 125 contacts, of which 49 COVID-19 infections had direct or indirect contact with the index case, qualifying him as a ""superspreader."" This propagated infection led to an outbreak in the community. Contact tracing, testing and isolation of such superspreaders from the other members of the community is essential to stop the spread of this disease and contain the COVID-19 pandemic."	1	Case Reports	COVID 19; community; contagious; infection; outbreak; superspreader	10.1177/2150132720987432	Mohindra R, Ghai A, Brar R, Khandelwal N, Biswal M, Suri V, Goyal K, Singh MP, Bhalla A, Rana K, Lakshmi PVM.

32390964	Discovery of Retro-1 Analogs Exhibiting Enhanced Anti-vaccinia Virus Activity	Orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) are an increasing threat to human health due to the growing population of OPXV-naive individuals after the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination. Antiviral drugs that are effective as postexposure treatments against variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) or other OPXVs are critical in the event of an OPXV outbreak or exposure. The only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat smallpox, Tecovirimat (ST-246), exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting extracellular virus (EV) formation, thereby preventing cell-cell and long-distance spread. We and others have previously demonstrated that host Golgi-associated retrograde proteins play an important role in monkeypox virus (MPXV) and vaccinia virus (VACV) EV formation. Inhibition of the retrograde pathway by small molecules such as Retro-2 has been shown to decrease VACV infection in vitro and to a lesser extent in vivo. To identify more potent inhibitors of the retrograde pathway, we screened a large panel of compounds containing a benzodiazepine scaffold like that of Retro-1, against VACV infection. We found that a subset of these compounds displayed better anti-VACV activity, causing a reduction in EV particle formation and viral spread compared to Retro-1. PA104 emerged as the most potent analog, inhibiting 90% viral spread at 1.3 μM with a high selectivity index. In addition, PA104 strongly inhibited two distinct ST-246-resistant viruses, demonstrating its potential benefit for use in combination therapy with ST-246. These data and further characterizations of the specific protein targets and in vivo efficacy of PA104 may have important implications for the design of effective antivirals against OPXV.

19623263	Rapid and high-throughput pan-Orthopoxvirus detection and identification using PCR and mass spectrometry	The genus Orthopoxvirus contains several species of related viruses, including the causative agent of smallpox (Variola virus). In addition to smallpox, several other members of the genus are capable of causing human infection, including monkeypox, cowpox, and other zoonotic rodent-borne poxviruses. Therefore, a single assay that can accurately identify all orthopoxviruses could provide a valuable tool for rapid broad orthopovirus identification. We have developed a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. The amplicons are detected using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on the Ibis T5000 system. We demonstrate that the assay can detect and identify a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits. The assay is sensitive at the stochastic limit of PCR and detected virus in blood containing approximately six plaque-forming units per milliliter from a rabbitpox virus-infected rabbit.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0006342	Eshoo MW, Whitehouse CA, Nalca A, Zoll S, Ecker JA, Hall TA, Pennella TT, Duncan DD, Desai A, Moradi EK, Rudnick K, Libby B, Ranken R, Sampath R, Hofstadler SA, Ecker DJ, Blyn LB.

19632316	Evaluation of the efficacy of modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)/IMVAMUNE against aerosolized rabbitpox virus in a rabbit model	Infection of rabbits with aerosolized rabbitpox virus (RPXV) produces a disease similar to monkeypox and smallpox in humans and provides a valuable, informative model system to test medical countermeasures against orthopoxviruses. Due to the eradication of smallpox, the evaluation of the efficacy of new-generation smallpox vaccines depends on relevant well-developed animal studies for vaccine licensure. In this study, we tested the efficacy of IMVAMUNE [modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN)] for protecting rabbits against aerosolized RPXV. Rabbits were vaccinated with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Dryvax, a single low dose of IMVAMUNE, a single high dose of IMVAMUNE, or twice with a high dose of IMVAMUNE. Aerosol challenge with a lethal dose of RPXV was performed 4 weeks after the last vaccination. All PBS control animals succumbed to the disease or were euthanized because of the disease within 7 days postexposure. The rabbits vaccinated with Dryvax, a low dose of IMVAMUNE, or a single high dose of IMVAMUNE showed minimal to moderate clinical signs of the disease, but all survived the challenge. The only clinical sign displayed by rabbits that had been vaccinated twice with a high dose of IMVAMUNE was mild transient anorexia in just two out of eight rabbits. This study shows that IMVAMUNE can be a very effective vaccine against aerosolized RPXV.	15	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.06.105	Garza NL, Hatkin JM, Livingston V, Nichols DK, Chaplin PJ, Volkmann A, Fisher D, Nalca A.

19538111	The new ACAM2000 vaccine and other therapies to control orthopoxvirus outbreaks and bioterror attacks	Quarantine, case tracing and population vaccination facilitated the global eradication, in 1980, of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. The vaccines used during the eradication period, including Dryvax, the smallpox vaccine used in the USA, were live vaccinia and cowpoxvirus-based vaccines, which induced long-lasting and cross-protective immunity against variola and other related poxviruses. These vaccine viruses were produced by serial propagation in domesticated animals. The drawbacks to such serially propagated live viral vaccines include the level of postvaccination local and systemic reactions and contraindications to their use in immunocompromised individuals, individuals with certain skin and cardiac diseases, and pregnant women. In the latter stages of the population-based smallpox vaccination campaign, research began with ways to improve safety and modernizing the manufacture of vaccinia vaccines; however, with the eradication of variola this work stopped. Outbreaks of monkeypoxvirus in humans and the bioterrorist threat of monkeypox and variola virus renewed the need for improved vaccinia vaccines. ACAM2000 is one of the new generation of smallpox vaccines. It is produced in cell culture from a clonally purified master seed stock of vaccinia derived from the New York City Board of Health strain of vaccinia. The clonally purified master seed assures a more homogeneous vaccine without the inherent mutations associated with serial propagation and the cell culture limits adventitious and bacterial contamination in vaccine production. In preclinical and clinical trials, ACAM2000 demonstrated an immunogenicity and safety profile similar to that of Dryvax.	15	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1586/erv.09.55	Handley L, Buller RM, Frey SE, Bellone C, Parker S.

16272340	Antibodies and CD8+ T cells are complementary and essential for natural resistance to a highly lethal cytopathic virus	It is believed that CD8+ T lymphocytes or Abs can independently clear many primary viral infections, including those caused by Orthopoxviruses (OPV), a genus that includes the human pathogens variola and monkeypox and the vaccine species vaccinia virus. However, most experiments addressing the role of Abs and CD8+ T cells in protection have used viruses that are not specific for the host. In the present study, we used the mouse-specific OPV ectromelia virus and mice deficient in CD40, B cells, or CD8+ T cells and adoptive transfers of CD8+ T or B lymphocytes to show that the protection afforded by CD8+ T cells is incomplete. Despite sustained CD8+ T cell responses, in the absence of Ab responses ectromelia virus persists. This results in delayed disease and inexorably leads to death. Therefore, CD8+ T lymphocytes and Abs are not redundant but complementary and essential to survive infections with a highly pathogenic viruses in the natural host.	67	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4049/jimmunol.175.10.6829	Fang M, Sigal LJ.

1700065	Structural and functional analysis of orthopoxvirus epitopes with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies	Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced in BALB/c mice immunized with live modified vaccinia virus Ankara or infected with sublethal doses of the neurovirulent vaccinia virus strain Munich 1. The immunization scheme proved to be important for obtaining MAbs of different specificity. The MAbs could be classified into three epitope groups (1 A, 1 B and 2). Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that the epitopes were localized on the virus surface. In immunoblotting, MAbs were reactive with polypeptides of 14K, 16K and 30K. Purified MAbs binding to the epitopes 1 A and 2 showed a 50% reduction of 100 p.f.u./0.05 ml vaccinia virus M1 with respectively 3.9 and 5.9 ng of immunoglobulin/0.05 ml. MAbs binding to the epitope 1 B neutralized the virus at a concentration of 250 ng/0.05 ml. In intraperitoneal challenge experiments, MAbs binding to the epitopes 1 A and 2 protected mice against 4 LD50 of vaccinia virus M1, but not against local lesions by subcutaneous application. MAbs against epitope 1 B had no protective effect in vivo. The three epitopes were present in 14 of 16 orthopoxviruses tested but with quantitative differences. Maximal binding (Vmax) and the antibody concentration at half-maximal binding (Km) which were calculated as for Michaelis-Menten kinetics from regression analysis of the ELISA data and the MAb concentration giving 50% plaque reduction were the basis for the evaluation. In monkey-pox virus Kopenhagen the epitopes 1 A and 1 B were absent. MAbs binding to epitope 2 reacted just as well as with vaccinia viruses. Ectromelia virus lacked all the epitopes.	23	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1099/0022-1317-71-10-2341	Czerny CP, Mahnel H.

18482742	Heterogeneity in the A33 protein impacts the cross-protective efficacy of a candidate smallpox DNA vaccine	We previously developed a gene-based vaccine, termed 4pox, which targets four orthopoxvirus proteins (A33, L1, B5, and A27). Because any subunit orthopoxvirus vaccine must protect against multiple species of orthopoxviruses, we are interested in understanding the cross-protective potential of our 4pox vaccine target immunogens. In our current studies, we focused on the A33 immunogen. We found one monoclonal antibody against A33, MAb-1G10, which could not bind the monkeypox virus A33 ortholog, A35. MAb-1G10 binding could be rescued if A35 amino acids 118 and 120 were substituted with those from A33. MAb-1G10 has been shown to protect mice from VACV challenge, thus our findings indicated a protective epitope differs among orthopoxviruses. Accordingly, we tested the cross-protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine consisting of A35R against VACV challenge and compared it to vaccination with A33R DNA. Mice vaccinated with A35R had greater mortality and more weight loss compared to those vaccinated with A33R. These findings demonstrate that despite high homology between A33R orthologs, amino acid differences can impact cross-protection. Furthermore, our results caution that adequate cross-protection by any pan-orthopoxvirus subunit vaccine will require not only careful evaluation of cross-protective immunity, but also of targeting of multiple orthopoxvirus immunogens.	17	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2008.04.003	Golden JW, Hooper JW.

30429979	Synthesis and antiviral activity of camphor-based 1,3-thiazolidin-4-one and thiazole derivatives as Orthopoxvirus-reproduction inhibitors	The Orthopoxvirus genus belongs to the Poxviridae family and includes variola virus (smallpox), cowpox virus, monkeypox virus and vaccinia virus (VV). Smallpox is considered one of the great epidemic disease scourges in human history. It has currently been eradicated; however, it remains a considerable threat as a biowarfare or bioterrorist weapon. The poxvirus, VV, serves as a model virus from which new antiviral therapies against Orthopoxviruses can be identified. Here, a series of nitrogen-sulphur containing heterocycles such as 1,3-thiazolidin-4-one and thiazoles containing a 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan scaffold were synthesized and screened for their antiviral activity. The bioassay results showed that the 4b, 4c and 4e thiazoles, which contained a substituted benzene ring, were able to inhibit VV reproduction with IC50 values in the 2.4-3.7 micromolar range whilst exhibiting moderate cytotoxicity. Among the thiazolidin-4-one derivatives, compound 8b, which contained a 4-methylbenzylidene group, displayed good inhibitory activity (IC50 = 9.5 μM) and moderate toxicity.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1039/c8md00347e	Sokolova AS, Yarovaya OI, Bormotov NI, Shishkina LN, Salakhutdinov NF.

19539971	Early viral protein synthesis is necessary for NF-kappaB activation in modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-infected 293 T fibroblast cells	Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated vaccinia virus, and is a promising vaccine vector for variola and monkeypox viruses, as well as for other pathogens. The MVA determinants important for vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity are poorly defined. MVA infection of fibroblast cells activates NF-kappaB, a characteristic not ascribed to wild-type vaccinia viruses. Thus, NF-kappaB activation, and the subsequent upregulation of host immune molecules, could be one of the determinants for MVA's immunogenicity. We report that ERK2 phosphorylation, an event preceding and required for NF-kappaB activation, occurred rapidly after virus infection. ERK2 and NF-kappaB remained inert when virus endocytosis was prevented, suggesting that virus-host cell interactions were insufficient for activating NF-kappaB. Inhibition of viral protein synthesis decreased NF-kappaB activation, and elimination of intermediate and late gene expression did not alter MVA-induced NF-kappaB activation. Thus, early gene expression activates NF-kappaB.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2009.05.014	Martin S, Shisler JL.

16023794	Evolutionary history of orthopoxvirus proteins similar to human complement regulators	Orthopoxviruses include many important pathogens such as variola major virus, camelpox, buffalopox, monkeypox, cowpox, and variola minor viruses. This group of viruses also includes vaccinia virus, which is extensively used in human vaccine development. Genomes of orthopoxviruses encode proteins with sequences similar to human regulators of complement activation (RCA) that contain tandem short consensus repeats (SCRs). We employed phylogenetic tree analysis to evaluate the structural relationships among SCRs of orthopoxvirus RCA-like proteins and those of human complement regulators. The human complement RCA proteins analyzed were factor H (FH), C4 binding protein alpha chain, membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay accelerating factor (DAF), and complement receptors type 1 (CR1) and 2 (CR2). Sequences of key poxvirus regulators of complement activation, vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP), smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes (SPICE), and cowpox inflammation modulatory protein (IMP) were similar to SCRs 1 through 5 of C4 binding protein, alpha chain, and they were also clustered with other homologous repeats of MCP, DAF, CR1, CR2, and FH. Phylogenetic clustering of RCA sequences suggested that poxvirus complement regulators VCP, SPICE, and IMP arose from a single ancestral sequence that shared similarity with all human regulators of complement activation. Any changes in poxvirus complement regulators leading to the enhancement of their ability to regulate complement activation likely resulted from new mutations in the viral lineages.	9	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.gene.2005.05.008	Ciulla E, Emery A, Konz D, Krushkal J.

12062386	Treatment of aerosolized cowpox virus infection in mice with aerosolized cidofovir	The Brighton strain of cowpox virus causes lethal bronchopneumonia when delivered as a small-particle (1 microm) aerosol to weanling BALB/c mice. We showed previously that this disease can be prevented or cured with one subcutaneous injection of cidofovir (HPMPC, Vistide). To determine whether even better results could be obtained by delivering the drug directly to the respiratory tract, we administered cidofovir by small-particle aqueous aerosol before or after aerosolized cowpox infection. In a series of five experiments, aerosol doses of 0.5-5 mg/kg were always more effective than 25 mg/kg and sometimes more effective than 100 mg/kg injected subcutaneously, as measured by changes in body and lung weight, lung viral titers, pulmonary pathology and survival. A cyclic analog ((1-[(S)-2-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,4,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)methyl] cytosine) (cHPMPC) was less protective. The results suggest that aerosolized cidofovir would be effective for prophylaxis or early post-exposure therapy of human smallpox or monkeypox virus infection.	17	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0166-3542(01)00220-0	Bray M, Martinez M, Kefauver D, West M, Roy C.

12018677	Antiviral activity and mode of action studies of ribavirin and mycophenolic acid against orthopoxviruses in vitro	Two inhibitors of cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and ribavirin, were evaluated for inhibitory activity against orthopoxviruses. Unrelated antipoxvirus agents tested for comparison included 6-azauridine, cidofovir (HPMPC) and cyclic HPMPC. MPA inhibited camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia viruses by 50% in plaque reduction assays at 0.2-3 microM in African green monkey kidney (Vero 76) and mouse 3T3 cells. Ribavirin was considerably more active in 3T3 cells (50% inhibition at 2-12 microM) than in Vero 76 cells (inhibitory at 30-250 microM) against these viruses. In cytotoxicity assays, MPA and ribavirin were more toxic to replicating cells than to stationary cell monolayers, with greater toxicity seen in 3T3 than in Vero 76 cells. The superior antiviral potency and increased toxicity of ribavirin in 3T3 cells was related to greater accumulation of mono-, di- and triphosphate forms of the drug compared with Vero 76 cells. For both MPA and ribavirin, virus inhibition was closely correlated to the extent of suppression of intracellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) pools. Treatment with extracellular guanosine (which restored intracellular GTP levels) did not lead to complete reversal of the anticowpox virus activity of ribavirin. This suggests that other modes of virus inhibition also appear to contribute to the anti-orthopoxvirus activity of ribavirin. Biological differences in mode of action and immunosuppressive potential between ribavirin and MPA may account for why the former compound is active against orthopoxvirus infections in animals and the latter inhibitor is not.	30	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1177/095632020101200602	Smee DF, Bray M, Huggins JW.

16361103	Application of transmission electron microscopy to the clinical study of viral and bacterial infections: present and future	Transmission electron microscopy has had a profound impact on our knowledge and understanding of viruses and bacteria. The 1000-fold improvement in resolution provided by electron microscopy (EM) has allowed visualization of viruses, the existence of which had previously only been suspected as the causative agents of transmissible infectious disease. Viruses are grouped into families based on their morphology. Viruses from different families look different and these morphological variances are the basis for identification of viruses by EM. Electron microscopy initially came to prominence in diagnostic microbiology in the late 1960s when it was used in the rapid diagnosis of smallpox, by differentiating, on a morphological basis, poxviruses from the less problematic herpesviruses in skin lesions. Subsequently, the technique was employed in the diagnosis of other viral infections, such as hepatitis B and parvovirus B19. Electron microscopy has led to the discovery of many new viruses, most notably the various viruses associated with gastroenteritis, for which it remained the principal diagnostic method until fairly recent times. Development of molecular techniques, which offer greater sensitivity and often the capacity to easily process large numbers of samples, has replaced EM in many areas of diagnostic virology. Hence the role of EM in clinical virology is evolving with less emphasis on diagnosis and more on research, although this is likely only to be undertaken in specialist centres. However, EM still offers tremendous advantages to the microbiologist, both in the speed of diagnosis and the potential for detecting, by a single test, any viral pathogen or even multiple pathogens present within a sample. There is continuing use of EM for the investigation of new and emerging agents, such as SARS and human monkeypox virus. Furthermore, EM forms a vital part of the national emergency response programme of many countries and will provide a frontline diagnostic service in the event of a bioterrorism incident, particularly in the scenario of a deliberate release of smallpox virus. In the field of bacteriology, EM is of little use diagnostically, although some bacterial pathogens can be identified in biopsy material processed for EM examination. Electron microscopy has been used, however, to elucidate the structure and function of many bacterial features, such as flagellae, fimbriae and spores and in the study of bacteriophages. The combined use of EM and gold-labelled antibodies provides a powerful tool for the ultrastructural localisation of bacterial and viral antigens.	34	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.micron.2005.10.001	Curry A, Appleton H, Dowsett B.

16301664	Diversity in the acute CD8 T cell response to vaccinia virus in humans	Orthopoxviruses have complex proteomes. Infection provokes a brisk CD8 response, which is required in some systems for recovery from primary infection. Little is known concerning the Ags and epitopes recognized by CD8 T cells. We examined the fine specificity of cloned and bulk human vaccinia-specific CD8 CTL by expressing polypeptide fragments from a library of vaccinia genomic DNA. This epitope discovery method emphasizes virus-specific biological activity, as the responder cells are all reactive with whole vaccinia virus. Sixteen novel epitopes, restricted by several HLA A and B alleles, were defined to the nomamer peptide level in diverse vaccinia open reading frames. An additional seven epitope were mapped to short regions of vaccinia proteins. Targets of the CD8 response included proteins assigned to structural, enzymatic, transcription factor, and immune evasion functions, and included members of all viral kinetic classes. Most epitopes were conserved in other orthopoxviruses. Responses to at least 18 epitopes were detected within a single blood sample, revealing a surprising degree of diversity. These epitopes will be useful in natural history studies of CD8 responses to vaccinia, a nonpersisting virus with long-term memory, and in the design and evaluation of attenuated and replication-incompetent vaccinia strains being tested for variola and monkeypox prevention and for the delivery of heterologous Ags.	32	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4049/jimmunol.175.11.7550	Jing L, Chong TM, McClurkan CL, Huang J, Story BT, Koelle DM.

26985679	Use of Vaccinia Virus Smallpox Vaccine in Laboratory and Health Care Personnel at Risk for Occupational Exposure to Orthopoxviruses - Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2015	On June 25, 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination with live smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine (ACAM2000) for laboratory personnel who directly handle 1) cultures or 2) animals contaminated or infected with replication-competent vaccinia virus, recombinant vaccinia viruses derived from replication-competent vaccinia strains (i.e., those that are capable of causing clinical infection and producing infectious virus in humans), or other orthopoxviruses that infect humans (e.g., monkeypox, cowpox, and variola) (recommendation category: A, evidence type 2 [Box]). Health care personnel (e.g., physicians and nurses) who currently treat or anticipate treating patients with vaccinia virus infections and whose contact with replication-competent vaccinia viruses is limited to contaminated materials (e.g., dressings) and persons administering ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine who adhere to appropriate infection prevention measures can be offered vaccination with ACAM2000 (recommendation category: B, evidence type 2 [Box]). These revised recommendations update the previous ACIP recommendations for nonemergency use of vaccinia virus smallpox vaccine for laboratory and health care personnel at risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses (1). Since 2001, when the previous ACIP recommendations were developed, ACAM2000 has replaced Dryvax as the only smallpox vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and available for use in the United States (2). These recommendations contain information on ACAM2000 and its use in laboratory and health care personnel at risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses.	13	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.15585/mmwr.mm6510a2	Petersen BW, Harms TJ, Reynolds MG, Harrison LH.

25476836	One Medicine One Science: a framework for exploring challenges at the intersection of animals, humans, and the environment	Characterizing the health consequences of interactions among animals, humans, and the environment in the face of climatic change, environmental disturbance, and expanding human populations is a critical global challenge in today's world. Exchange of interdisciplinary knowledge in basic and applied sciences and medicine that includes scientists, health professionals, key sponsors, and policy experts revealed that relevant case studies of monkeypox, influenza A, tuberculosis, and HIV can be used to guide strategies for anticipating and responding to new disease threats such as the Ebola and Chickungunya viruses, as well as to improve programs to control existing zoonotic diseases, including tuberculosis. The problem of safely feeding the world while preserving the environment and avoiding issues such as antibiotic resistance in animals and humans requires cooperative scientific problem solving. Food poisoning outbreaks resulting from Salmonella growing in vegetables have demonstrated the need for knowledge of pathogen evolution and adaptation in developing appropriate countermeasures for prevention and policy development. Similarly, pesticide use for efficient crop production must take into consideration bee population declines that threaten the availability of the two-thirds of human foods that are dependent on pollination. This report presents and weighs the objective merits of competing health priorities and identifies gaps in knowledge that threaten health security, to promote discussion of major public policy implications such that they may be decided with at least an underlying platform of facts.	15	Information Unavailable	One Medicine One Science; emerging infectious disease; food safety; food security; global health; iCOMOS; one health	10.1111/nyas.12601	Travis DA, Sriramarao P, Cardona C, Steer CJ, Kennedy S, Sreevatsan S, Murtaugh MP.

19752270	ST-246 inhibits in vivo poxvirus dissemination, virus shedding, and systemic disease manifestation	Orthopoxvirus infections, such as smallpox, can lead to severe systemic disease and result in considerable morbidity and mortality in immunologically naïve individuals. Treatment with ST-246, a small-molecule inhibitor of virus egress, has been shown to provide protection against severe disease and death induced by several members of the poxvirus family, including vaccinia, variola, and monkeypox viruses. Here, we show that ST-246 treatment not only results in the significant inhibition of vaccinia virus dissemination from the site of inoculation to distal organs, such as the spleen and liver, but also reduces the viral load in organs targeted by the dissemination. In mice intranasally infected with vaccinia virus, virus shedding from the nasal and lung mucosa was significantly lower (approximately 22- and 528-fold, respectively) upon ST-246 treatment. Consequently, virus dissemination from the nasal site of replication to the lung also was dramatically reduced, as evidenced by a 179-fold difference in virus levels in nasal versus bronchoalveolar lavage. Furthermore, in ACAM2000-immunized mice, vaccination site swabs showed that ST-246 treatment results in a major (approximately 3,900-fold by day 21) reduction in virus detected at the outside surfaces of lesions. Taken together, these data suggest that ST-246 would play a dual protective role if used during a smallpox bioterrorist attack. First, ST-246 would provide therapeutic benefit by reducing the disease burden and lethality in infected individuals. Second, by reducing virus shedding from those prophylactically immunized with a smallpox vaccine or harboring variola virus infection, ST-246 could reduce the risk of virus transmission to susceptible contacts.	20	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.00678-09	Berhanu A, King DS, Mosier S, Jordan R, Jones KF, Hruby DE, Grosenbach DW.

However, some essential tools for their study that are taken for granted with other mouse models are not available for these viruses. Here we map and characterize the initial CD8+ T-cell determinants for poxviruses in H-2d-haplotype mice. CD8+ T cells recognizing these three determinants make up around 40% of the total responses to vaccinia virus during and after resolution of infection. We then use these determinants to test if predicted conservation across orthopoxvirus species matches experimental observation and find an unexpectedly cross-reactive variant peptide encoded by ectromelia (mousepox) virus.	72	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.00427-06	Tscharke DC, Woo WP, Sakala IG, Sidney J, Sette A, Moss DJ, Bennink JR, Karupiah G, Yewdell JW.

15482195	Emerging infectious diseases: vulnerabilities, contributing factors and approaches	We live in an ever more connected global village linked through international travel, politics, economics, culture and human-human and human-animal interactions. The realization that the concept of globalization includes global exposure to disease-causing agents that were formerly confined to small, remote areas and that infectious disease outbreaks can have political, economic and social roots and effects is becoming more apparent. Novel infectious disease microbes continue to be discovered because they are new or newly recognized, have expanded their geographic range, have been shown to cause a new disease spectrum, have jumped the species barrier from animals to humans, have become resistant to antimicrobial agents, have increased in incidence or have become more virulent. These emerging infectious disease microbes may have the potential for use as agents of bioterrorism. Factors involved in the emergence of infectious diseases are complex and interrelated and involve all classifications of organisms transmitted in a variety of ways. In 2003, outbreaks of interest included severe acute respiratory syndrome, monkeypox and avian influenza. Information from the human genome project applied to microbial organisms and their hosts will provide new opportunities for detection, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, control and prognosis. New technology related not only to genetics but also to satellite and monitoring systems will play a role in weather, climate and the approach to environmental manipulations that influence factors contributing to infectious disease emergence and control. Approaches to combating emerging infectious diseases include many disciplines, such as animal studies, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, environmental studies, microbiology, pharmacology, other sciences, health, medicine, public health, nursing, cultural, political and social studies, all of which must work together. Appropriate financial support of the public health infrastructure including surveillance, prevention, communication, adherence techniques and the like will be needed to support efforts to address emerging infectious disease threats.	13	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1586/14787210.2.2.299	Lashley FR.

12615302	A review of compounds exhibiting anti-orthopoxvirus activity in animal models	Several animal models using mice (most frequently), rabbits, or monkeys have been used to identify compounds active against orthopoxvirus infections. The treatment of vaccinia virus infections has been well studied in models involving infection of scarified skin or eyes, or resulting from intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, or intranasal virus inoculation. Cowpox virus has been used in intranasal or aerosol infection studies to evaluate the treatment of lethal respiratory infections. Rabbitpox, monkeypox, and variola viruses have been employed to a lesser extent than the other viruses in chemotherapy experiments. A review of the literature over the past 50 years has identified a number of compounds effective in treating one or more of these infections, which include thiosemicarbazones, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, interferon, interferon inducers, and other unrelated compounds. Substances that appear to have the greatest potential as anti-orthopoxvirus agents are the acyclic nucleotides, (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (cidofovir, HPMPC) and 1-[((S)-2-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,4,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)methyl]cytosine (cyclic HPMPC), and the acyclic nucleoside analog, 2-amino-7-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]purine (S2242). Other classes of compounds that have not been sufficiently studied in lethal infection models and deserve further consideration are thiosemicarbazones related to methisazone, and analogs of adenosine-N(1)-oxide and 1-(benzyloxy)adenosine.	30	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/s0166-3542(02)00199-7	Smee DF, Sidwell RW.

34316355	iCAT: diagnostic assessment tool of immunological history using high-throughput T-cell receptor sequencing	The pathogen exposure history of an individual is recorded in their T-cell repertoire and can be accessed through the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs) if the tools to identify them were available. For each T-cell, the TCR loci undergoes genetic rearrangement that creates a unique DNA sequence. In theory these unique sequences can be used as biomarkers for tracking T-cell responses and cataloging immunological history. We developed the immune Cell Analysis Tool (iCAT), an R software package that analyzes TCR sequencing data from exposed (positive) and unexposed (negative) samples to identify TCR sequences statistically associated with positive samples. The presence and absence of associated sequences in samples trains a classifier to diagnose pathogen-specific exposure. We demonstrate the high accuracy of iCAT by testing on three TCR sequencing datasets. First, iCAT successfully diagnosed smallpox vaccinated versus naïve samples in an independent cohort of mice with 95% accuracy. Second, iCAT displayed 100% accuracy classifying naïve and monkeypox vaccinated mice. Finally, we demonstrate the use of iCAT on human samples before and after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 global pandemic. We were able to correctly classify the exposed samples with perfect accuracy. These experimental results show that iCAT capitalizes on the power of TCR sequencing to simplify infection diagnostics. iCAT provides the option of a graphical, user-friendly interface on top of usual R interface allowing it to reach a wider audience.

15043161	Anti-cowpox virus activities of certain adenosine analogs, arabinofuranosyl nucleosides, and 2&#x27;-fluoro-arabinofuranosyl nucleosides	Nucleoside analogs were investigated for their potential to inhibit cowpox virus (a surrogate for variola and monkeypox viruses) in cell culture and in lethal respiratory infections in mice. Cell culture antiviral activity was determined by plaque reduction assays, with cytotoxicity determined by cell proliferation assays. Selectivity indices (SI's, 50% cytotoxic concentration divided by 50% virus-inhibitory concentration) were determined for 15 compounds. Three arabinofuranosyl (Ara) nucleosides showed activity in mouse mammary tumor (C127I) cells: guanine (Ara-G), thymine (Ara-T), and adenine (Ara-A) with SI's of 113, 61, and 95, respectively. The 2'-fluoro-Ara nucleosides of 5-F-cytosine (FIAC), 5-methyluracil (FMAU), and 5-iodouracil (FIAU) exhibited SI's of 148, 77, and 29, respectively. Other potent compounds included cidofovir (a positive control) and 3'-O-methyladenosine, with SI values of 164 and 56, respectively. In general, assays performed in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells produced lower SI's than in C127I cells, except for 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IDU) which had an SI of > 71 in Vero cells and 3.1 in C127I cells. Intranasal infection of mice with cowpox virus was followed a day later by twice daily intraperitoneal treatment with compounds for 5 days. Ara-A was active at 300 mg/kg/day (40% survival), FMAU at 100 mg/kg/day (70% survival), and cidofovir (given for 1 day only) at 100 mg/kg (80-100% survival). None of the other compounds, including IDU, prevented death nor delayed the time to death. Cidofovir had the best potential for treating orthopoxvirus infections of those tested.	8	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1081/ncn-120028334	Smee DF, Sidwell RW.

29495547	Modulating Vaccinia Virus Immunomodulators to Improve Immunological Memory	The increasing frequency of monkeypox virus infections, new outbreaks of other zoonotic orthopoxviruses and concern about the re-emergence of smallpox have prompted research into developing antiviral drugs and better vaccines against these viruses. This article considers the genetic engineering of vaccinia virus (VACV) to enhance vaccine immunogenicity and safety. The virulence, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of VACV strains engineered to lack specific immunomodulatory or host range proteins are described.

21205446	Generation of a specific-pathogen-free baboon colony	We undertook establishing an SPF baboon colony in response to requests from researchers. To enable the widest possible future use of SPF baboons, our aim was to develop an SPF colony of baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) free of 12 target viruses: 5 herpesviruses, 4 retroviruses, simian virus 40, measles, and monkeypox. Infant baboons were removed from their mothers within 24 h of birth and nursery-reared. Groups of 3 to 8 age-matched conspecifics were isolated in separate rooms for 1 y while undergoing repeated testing for target viruses. During the initial 7 y of the SPF program, 171 infants were enrolled, of which 76 (44.4%) subsequently were removed from the program. Of those removed, 54 (71.0%) were culled due to breaks in virus-free status, 12 (15.8%) died of various causes, 4 (5.3%) developed seizures, and 6 (7.9%) were removed for other reasons. The most problematic viruses were baboon cytomegalovirus (25.9% of culls), Herpesvirus papio 1 (51.9%), and simian foamy virus (7.4%). Using conspecific groups of 3 to 4 infants reduced first-year program losses as compared with groups of 6 to 8. There have been 17 births in the SPF colony, and all these infants have been free of all target viruses since birth. On the basis of these results, early removal of infants from their dams, housing in small peer groups, frequent virus testing, and aggressive culling of virus-positive animals is an effective approach for development of a baboon colony free of multiple viruses.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	Wolf RF, Eberle R, White GL.

21261824	Massively parallel pathogen identification using high-density microarrays	Identification of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens is still performed by phenotypic methods that are often slow and cumbersome, despite the availability of more comprehensive genotyping technologies. We present an approach based on whole-genome amplification and resequencing microarrays for unbiased pathogen detection. This 10 h process identifies a broad spectrum of bacterial and viral species and predicts antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity and virulence profiles. We successfully identify a variety of bacteria and viruses, both in isolation and in complex mixtures, and the high specificity of the microarray distinguishes between different pathogens that cause diseases with overlapping symptoms. The resequencing approach also allows identification of organisms whose sequences are not tiled on the array, greatly expanding the repertoire of identifiable organisms and their variants. We identify organisms by hybridization of their DNA in as little as 1-4 h. Using this method, we identified Monkeypox virus and drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a skin lesion taken from a child suspected of an orthopoxvirus infection, despite poor transport conditions of the sample, and a vast excess of human DNA. Our results suggest this technology could be applied in a clinical setting to test for numerous pathogens in a rapid, sensitive and unbiased manner.	22	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.1751-7915.2007.00012.x	Berthet N, Dickinson P, Filliol I, Reinhardt AK, Batejat C, Vallaeys T, Kong KA, Davies C, Lee W, Zhang S, Turpaz Y, Heym B, Coralie G, Dacheux L, Burguière AM, Bourhy H, Old IG, Manuguerra JC, Cole ST, Kennedy GC.

16919703	Immunogenicity and protection efficacy of monovalent and polyvalent poxvirus vaccines that include the D8 antigen	Recent studies have established the feasibility of subunit-based experimental vaccines to protect animals from lethal poxvirus infection. Individual outer membrane proteins from intracellular and extracellular virions of vaccinia virus, when delivered in the form of either DNA vaccines or recombinant protein vaccines produced from baculovirus-infected insect cells, were able to protect mice from the vaccinia virus challenge and rhesus macaques from the monkeypox virus challenge. The polyvalent formulations with various combinations of the four poxvirus antigens (A27, L1, B5 and A33) achieved better protection than the monovalent formulation using only one of these antigens. However, it is not clear whether any of the remaining outer membrane poxvirus proteins can further improve the efficacy of the current polyvalent formulations. In this study, we conducted detailed analysis on the immunogenicity of D8, a previously reported protective antigen from intracellular mature virions. Our results indicated that D8 induced strong protective antibody responses and was effective in improving the efficacy of previously reported polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations.

35038257	Human Monkey Pox Virus Infection in Plateau State, North Central Nigeria: A Report of Two Cases	Background: Human Monkey Pox Virus (HMPV) infection is a zoonotic infection that is endemic in the Congo basin and West Africa. Its similarity to smallpox infection, increased susceptibility infection in human populations, lack of a definitive therapy and its potential for use as a bioterrorism tool underscores its public health importance. Objective: To describe the characteristics of HMPV infection in Plateau State, North Central Nigeria. Methods: This was a case study of HMPV infection occurring in two Nigerian adults, seen in 2018, at Bingham University Teaching Hospital in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. The cases involved two siblings, and these were the first reported cases in Plateau State of Nigeria, which has an estimated population of 3.5 million persons. The diagnosis was based on a combination of clinical features and positive PCR tests on samples from the skin lesions and blood. Results: The first case, a 20-year-old male, presented with a one week history of fever, headache, pain on swallowing and micturition, and generalised skin lesions. The second case is a 20 year old step brother of the first case, and the primary care provider to first case when he took ill. He also presented with a one-week history of fever, headache, pain on swallowing, and skin lesions which were less intense than in the first case. PCR assays of samples from the skin lesions and blood were positive in both cases. The other comorbidity in both cases was pharyngotonsillitis. Blood, throat, stool, and urine cultures for suspected sepsis and urinary tract infection were all negative. Both cases were admitted and discharged after receiving a course of antibiotics, antihistamine, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, and multivitamins. Universal precautions were observed. Conclusion: HMPV infection in our environment underscores the need to strengthen preventive health strategies against this infection.

29446492	Bayesian reconstruction of the evolutionary history and cross-species transition of variola virus and orthopoxviruses	Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, is an exclusively human virus belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus, which includes many other viral species covering a wide range of mammal hosts, such as vaccinia, cowpox, camelpox, taterapox, ectromelia, and monkeypox virus. The tempo and mode of evolution of Orthopoxviruses were reconstructed using a Bayesian phylodynamic framework by analysing 80 hemagglutinin sequences retrieved from public databases. Bayesian phylogeography was used to estimate their putative ancestral hosts. In order to estimate the substitution rate, the tree including all of the available Orthopoxviruses was calibrated using historical references dating the South American variola minor clade (alastrim) to between the XVI and XIX century. The mean substitution rate determined by the analysis was 6.5 × 10-6 substitutions/site/year. Based on this evolutionary estimate, the time of the most recent common ancestor of the genus Orthopoxvirus was placed at about 10 000 years before the present. Cowpox virus was the species closest to the root of the phylogenetic tree. The root of VARV circulating in the XX century was estimated to be about 700 years ago, corresponding to about 1300 AD. The divergence between West African and South American VARV went back about 500 years ago (falling approximately in the XVI century). A rodent species is the most probable ancestral host from which the ancestors of all the known Orthopoxviruses were transmitted to the other mammal host species, and each of these species represented a dead-end for each new poxvirus species, without any further inter-specific spread.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jmv.25055	Zehender G, Lai A, Veo C, Bergna A, Ciccozzi M, Galli M.

12775171	U.S. military officer participation in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s Epidemic Intelligence Service (1951-2001)	The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) was created in 1951 to provide epidemiologists to investigate natural and intentional disease epidemics. From an initial class of 23 U.S. citizens, the program has evolved into a globally recognized, hands-on learning experience, accepting approximately 65 to 75 new officers each year. The first U.S. military epidemic intelligence service officer (EISO) was accepted into the program in 1994. Since that time, 12 such officers have completed, or have begun, EIS training. They have comprised 2.1% of all EISOs from 1994 to 2001 and 0.47% of all EISOs. This total has included nine Air Force veterinarians, one Army veterinarian, one Army physician, and one Navy physician. Each military EISO had the opportunity to lead investigations of significant public health events (e.g., Ebola, monkeypox, malaria, Nipah virus, West Nile fever, and anthrax outbreaks). All graduates from the military returned to active duty assignments in operational medical units, research institutes, or the intelligence community.

7513922	Epitope detection in the envelope of intracellular naked orthopox viruses and identification of encoding genes	Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were generated against vaccinia virus, cowpox virus KR2 Brighton, monkeypox virus Copenhagen, or ectromelia virus. Pairwise epitope specificity studies by competition ELISAs identified 23 distinct antigenic sites in 19 different orthopox virus strains. Six epitopes were completely independent of each other, and 17 closely related antigenic sites formed three separate epitope complexes. As shown by immunogold electron microscopy (ELMI), all MAbs reacted with epitopes in the envelope of intracellular naked virus, 16 MAbs recognized proteins of 32, 30, 16 or 14 kDa in Western blotting (WB), and 9 MAbs neutralized virus infectivity. In rabbitpox virus (RPV) 18 epitopes were detected. A lambda gt11 expression library of RPV DNA was screened with the corresponding 18 MAbs. Fourteen recombinant bacteriophage clones (ph) were isolated. Cross-hybridizations of phage and RPV DNA demonstrated a reaction with the HindIII A, HindIII D, or HindIII H fragments, respectively. DNA of ph3D was related to the A25L gene, which corresponds to the A-type inclusion body gene of cowpox virus. Two phage clones contained sequences of the 14-kDa fusion protein gene (A27L gene). Ph1A contained nearly the entire 14-kDa gene encoding 4 neutralizing (neutr) and 2 nonneutr epitopes. Ph5, expressing only half of this gene product, encoded 1 nonneutr epitope. The fusion protein of vaccinia virus MVA was isolated by immune-affinity chromatography with a neutr. catching MAb. The protein formed hollow rods (ELMI) and the 6 antigenic sites that were present were identical to those expressed by Escherichia coli infected with ph1A. WB detection with a polyclonal hyperimmune serum detected protein bands of 54, 32, 30, 16, and 14 kDa. The catching MAb bound only to a 16-kDa band. The purified fusion protein induced neutralizing antibodies in mice and rabbits.	13	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1006/viro.1994.1240	Czerny CP, Johann S, Hölzle L, Meyer H.

31079914	[Human poxvirus infections]	Poxvirus (PXV) infections are a common cause of cutaneous signs. In France, certain forms of poxvirus are frequent and benign (molluscum contagiosum), while others are rare but potentially serious (cowpox virus [CPXV]). Whereas only smallpox and molluscum contagiosum viruses have a human reservoir and are transmitted between humans, most poxvirus infections are zoonoses having only animal reservoirs. Only a small number of poxviruses are responsible for infection in humans, but the increasing number of new pets, some of which are exotic, coupled with the rapid rise in international travel are creating a greater risk of transmission of zoonotic PXV to new vectors and of spread of these diseases to new regions throughout the world. In France, molluscum contagiosum, orf and milkers' nodule give rise to numerous consultations and are well known to dermatologists. However, dermatologists must also be able to identify other parapoxviruses of similar presentation to orf; thus, CPXV and monkeypox are considered potentially emergent viruses with a high risk of epidemic and spread due to increasing international transport and the loss of the maximum protection against smallpox. Finally, despite its declared eradication, smallpox is currently being monitored because of the potential risk of reintroduction, whether accidentally or deliberately through bioterrorism.	1	Review	Molluscum contagiosum; Orf; Orthopoxvirus; Parapoxvirus; Poxvirus; Smallpox; Variole	10.1016/j.annder.2019.03.001	Bohelay G, Duong TA.

23110193	Tin oxide nanowires suppress herpes simplex virus-1 entry and cell-to-cell membrane fusion	The advent of nanotechnology has ushered in the use of modified nanoparticles as potential antiviral agents against diseases such as herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1) (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), monkeypox virus, and hepatitis B virus. Here we describe the application of tin oxide (SnO(2)) nanowires as an effective treatment against HSV-1 infection. SnO(2) nanowires work as a carrier of negatively charged structures that compete with HSV-1 attachment to cell bound heparan sulfate (HS), therefore inhibiting entry and subsequent cell-to-cell spread. This promising new approach can be developed into a novel form of broad-spectrum antiviral therapy especially since HS has been shown to serve as a cellular co-receptor for a number of other viruses as well, including the respiratory syncytial virus, adeno-associated virus type 2, and human papilloma virus.	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0048147	Trigilio J, Antoine TE, Paulowicz I, Mishra YK, Adelung R, Shukla D.

20080762	Efficacy of ST-246 versus lethal poxvirus challenge in immunodeficient mice	The threat of smallpox as a bioweapon and the emerging threat of human monkeypox, among other poxviral diseases, highlight the need for effective poxvirus countermeasures. ST-246, which targets the F13L protein in vaccinia virus and its homologs in other orthopoxvirus species, provides full protection from lethal poxviral disease in numerous animal models and seems to be safe in humans. All previous evaluations of ST-246 efficacy have been in immunocompetent animals. However, the risk of severe poxviral disease is greater in immunodeficient hosts. Here we report on the efficacy of ST-246 in preventing or treating lethal poxviral disease in immunodeficient mice. After lethal challenge with the Western Reserve strain of vaccinia, Nude, SCID, and J(H) knockout mice additionally depleted of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were not fully protected by ST-246, although survival was significantly extended. However, CD4(+) T cell deficient, CD8(+) T cell deficient, J(H) knockout, and J(H) knockout mice also deficient for CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells survived lethal challenge when treated with ST-246 starting on the day of challenge. Delaying treatment until 72 h after infection reduced ST-246 efficacy in some models but provided full protection from lethal challenge in most. These findings suggest that ST-246 may be effective in controlling smallpox or other pathogenic orthopoxviruses in some immunodeficient human populations for whom the vaccine is contraindicated.	23	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1073/pnas.0912134107	Grosenbach DW, Berhanu A, King DS, Mosier S, Jones KF, Jordan RA, Bolken TC, Hruby DE.

15986492	Cross-species transfer of viruses: implications for the use of viral vectors in biomedical research, gene therapy and as live-virus vaccines	All living organisms are continuously exposed to a plethora of viruses. In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host-range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross-species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The opportunities for cross-species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic. Against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live-vector vaccines is a cause for concern. This review addresses a number of potential risk factors and their implications for activities with viral vectors from the perspective of cross-species transfer of viruses in nature, with emphasis on the occurrence of host-range mutants resulting from either cell culture or tropism engineering. The issues are raised with the intention to assist in risk assessments for activities with vector viruses.	10	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1002/jgm.794	Louz D, Bergmans HE, Loos BP, Hoeben RC.

12183236	Effect of 5-iodo-2&#x27;-deoxyuridine on vaccinia virus (orthopoxvirus) infections in mice	There is a concern that there may be unregistered stocks of smallpox that can be used for bioterrorism or biological warfare. According to the WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Research, there is a need to develop strategies to treat smallpox infections should they reappear. It would also be important to have an effective drug at hand for the treatment of monkeypox disease in humans. We show here that 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IDU) is a potent inhibitor of vaccinia virus (VV) replication and that IDU inhibits VV DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent way. The in vivo protective effect of IDU was assessed in the VV tail lesion model in immunocompetent mice and in a lethal model for VV infection in SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) mice that had been infected either intranasally, intraperitoneally, or intravenously. Subcutaneous treatment with IDU at 150 and 100 mg/kg of body weight markedly reduced the number of tail lesions in immunocompetent NMRI mice. Untreated intranasally VV-infected SCID mice died at 20.8 +/- 3.1 days after infection (mean +/- standard deviation). Treatment with IDU (subcutaneously, 150 mg/kg/day [from day 0 to 4] and 75 mg/kg/day [from day 6 to 11]) delayed-virus induced mortality by 15 days (mean day of death +/- standard deviation, 35.8 +/- 6.7; P < 0.0001). This protective effect was associated with (i) an improvement of lung histology and (ii) a marked reduction in lung viral titers. IDU also delayed VV-induced mortality when mice had either been infected intraperitoneally or intravenously. Even when the start of treatment with IDU (in intraperitoneally VV-infected mice) was postponed until 2 or 4 days after infection, an important delay in virus-induced mortality was noted.	12	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.46.9.2842-2847.2002	Neyts J, Verbeken E, De Clercq E.

29676720	Mutagenic repair of double-stranded DNA breaks in vaccinia virus genomes requires cellular DNA ligase IV activity in the cytosol	Poxviruses comprise a group of large dsDNA viruses that include members relevant to human and animal health, such as variola virus, monkeypox virus, cowpox virus and vaccinia virus (VACV). Poxviruses are remarkable for their unique replication cycle, which is restricted to the cytoplasm of infected cells. The independence from the host nucleus requires poxviruses to encode most of the enzymes involved in DNA replication, transcription and processing. Here, we use the CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system to induce DNA damage to VACV (strain Western Reserve) genomes. We show that targeting CRISPR/Cas9 to essential viral genes limits virus replication efficiently. Although VACV is a strictly cytoplasmic pathogen, we observed extensive viral genome editing at the target site; this is reminiscent of a non-homologous end-joining DNA repair mechanism. This pathway was not dependent on the viral DNA ligase, but critically involved the cellular DNA ligase IV. Our data show that DNA ligase IV can act outside of the nucleus to allow repair of dsDNA breaks in poxvirus genomes. This pathway might contribute to the introduction of mutations within the genome of poxviruses and may thereby promote the evolution of these viruses.	4	Information Unavailable	CRISPR/Cas9; DNA ligase IV; Poxvirus; genome editing; mutagenesis; viral genome repair	10.1099/jgv.0.001034	Luteijn RD, Drexler I, Smith GL, Lebbink RJ, Wiertz EJHJ.

21197387	Therapeutic Vaccines and Antibodies for Treatment of Orthopoxvirus Infections	Despite the eradication of smallpox several decades ago, variola and monkeypox viruses still have the potential to become significant threats to public health. The current licensed live vaccinia virus-based smallpox vaccine is extremely effective as a prophylactic vaccine to prevent orthopoxvirus infections, but because of safety issues, it is no longer given as a routine vaccine to the general population. In the event of serious human orthopoxvirus infections, it is important to have treatments available for individual patients as well as their close contacts. The smallpox vaccine and vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) were used in the past as therapeutics for patients exposed to smallpox. VIG was also used in patients who were at high risk of developing complications from smallpox vaccination. Thus post-exposure vaccination and VIG treatments may again become important therapeutic modalities. This paper summarizes some of the historic use of the smallpox vaccine and immunoglobulins in the post-exposure setting in humans and reviews in detail the newer animal studies that address the use of therapeutic vaccines and immunoglobulins in orthopoxvirus infections as well as the development of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.	2	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.3390/v2102381	Xiao Y, Isaacs SN.

20628573	Vaccinia virus-encoded ribonucleotide reductase subunits are differentially required for replication and pathogenesis	Ribonucleotide reductases (RRs) are evolutionarily-conserved enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting step during dNTP synthesis in mammals. RR consists of both large (R1) and small (R2) subunits, which are both required for catalysis by the R1(2)R2(2) heterotetrameric complex. Poxviruses also encode RR proteins, but while the Orthopoxviruses infecting humans [e.g. vaccinia (VACV), variola, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses] encode both R1 and R2 subunits, the vast majority of Chordopoxviruses encode only R2 subunits. Using plaque morphology, growth curve, and mouse model studies, we investigated the requirement of VACV R1 (I4) and R2 (F4) subunits for replication and pathogenesis using a panel of mutant viruses in which one or more viral RR genes had been inactivated. Surprisingly, VACV F4, but not I4, was required for efficient replication in culture and virulence in mice. The growth defects of VACV strains lacking F4 could be complemented by genes encoding other Chordopoxvirus R2 subunits, suggesting conservation of function between poxvirus R2 proteins. Expression of F4 proteins encoding a point mutation predicted to inactivate RR activity but still allow for interaction with R1 subunits, caused a dominant negative phenotype in growth experiments in the presence or absence of I4. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that F4 (as well as other Chordopoxvirus R2 subunits) form hybrid complexes with cellular R1 subunits. Mutant F4 proteins that are unable to interact with host R1 subunits failed to rescue the replication defect of strains lacking F4, suggesting that F4-host R1 complex formation is critical for VACV replication. Our results suggest that poxvirus R2 subunits form functional complexes with host R1 subunits to provide sufficient dNTPs for viral replication. Our results also suggest that R2-deficient poxviruses may be selective oncolytic agents and our bioinformatic analyses provide insights into how poxvirus nucleotide metabolism proteins may have influenced the base composition of these pathogens.	32	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1000984	Gammon DB, Gowrishankar B, Duraffour S, Andrei G, Upton C, Evans DH.

16528357	What dermatologists do not know about smallpox vaccination: results from a worldwide electronic survey	The risk of a bioterrorist attack with smallpox has increased owing to breakthroughs in the de novo synthesis of long-chain DNA molecules. Although the leading roles of dermatologists in diagnosing recent outbreaks of cutaneous anthrax and monkeypox demonstrate the importance of dermatologist preparedness for bioterrorism, dermatologist knowledge regarding smallpox vaccination has not been extensively examined. We conducted a cross-sectional worldwide electronic survey of all members of the American Academy of Dermatology with available e-mail addresses. The response rate was 23% (1,303/5,723): 34% of respondents were women, 52% were age 50 or older, 85% practiced in the US, and 90% reported English as their primary language. Less than 37% indicated the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated rate of death owing to smallpox vaccination (1 in 1,000,000), and many failed to identify vaccination contraindications: previous myocardial infarction (83%), angina (83%), congestive heart failure (78%), steroid eye drop use (65%), and the non-emergency vaccination of those younger than age 18 (95%). Widespread dermatologist smallpox vaccination knowledge deficits pinpoint opportunities for educational efforts.	1	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1038/sj.jid.5700235	Dellavalle RP, Heilig LF, Francis SO, Johnson KR, Hester EJ, McNealy KM, Schilling LM, Weston WL.

33605479	(+)-Camphor and (-)-borneol derivatives as potential anti-orthopoxvirus agents	Although the World Health Organisation had announced that smallpox was eradicated over 40 years ago, the disease and other related pathogenic poxviruses such as monkeypox remain potential bioterrorist weapons and could also re-emerge as natural infections. We have previously reported (+)-camphor and (-)-borneol derivatives with an antiviral activity against the vaccinia virus. This virus is similar to the variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, but can be studied at BSL-2 facilities. In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of the most potent compounds against VARV, cowpox virus, and ectromelia virus (ECTV). Among the compounds tested, 4-bromo-N'-((1R,4R)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ylidene)benzohydrazide 18 is the most effective compound against various orthopoxviruses, including VARV, with an EC50 value of 13.9 μM and a selectivity index of 206. Also, (+)-camphor thiosemicarbazone 9 was found to be active against VARV and ECTV.	3	Information Unavailable	(+)-camphor; (−)-borneol; cowpox virus; ectromelia virus; vaccinia virus; variola virus	10.1002/ardp.202100038	Sokolova AS, Kovaleva KS, Yarovaya OI, Bormotov NI, Shishkina LN, Serova OA, Sergeev AA, Agafonov AP, Maksuytov RA, Salakhutdinov NF.

17617623	Human cytotoxic CD4+ T cells recognize HLA-DR1-restricted epitopes on vaccinia virus proteins A24R and D1R conserved among poxviruses	We previously demonstrated that vaccinia virus (VV)-specific CD4(+) cytolytic T cells can persist for >50 years after immunization against smallpox in the absence of re-exposure to VV. Nevertheless, there have been few studies focusing on CD4(+) T cell responses to smallpox vaccination. To ensure successful vaccination, a candidate vaccine should contain immunodominant CD4(+) T cell epitopes as well as CD8(+) T and B cell epitopes. In the present study, we established cytotoxic CD4(+) T cell lines from VV-immune donors, which recognize epitopes in VV proteins D1R and A24R in association with HLA-DR1 Ags. Comparisons of sequences between different members of the poxvirus family show that both epitopes are completely conserved among VV, variola viruses, and most mammalian poxviruses, including monkeypox, cowpox, and ectromelia. The CD4(+) T cell lines lysed VV-infected, Ag- and peptide-pulsed targets, and the lysis was inhibited by concanamycin A. We also detected these peptide-specific cytolytic and IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) T cells in short-term bulk cultures of PBMC from each of the three VV-immune donors tested. These are the first VV-specific CD4(+) T cell epitopes identified in humans restricted by one of the most common MHC class II molecules, HLA-DR1, and this information may be useful in analyzing CD4(+) T cell responses to pre-existing or new generation VV vaccines against smallpox.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4049/jimmunol.179.2.1303	Mitra-Kaushik S, Cruz J, Stern LJ, Ennis FA, Terajima M.

15608205	Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center: a comprehensive Poxviridae informational and analytical resource	The Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center (PBRC) has been established to provide informational and analytical resources to the scientific community to aid research directed at providing a better understanding of the Poxviridae family of viruses. The PBRC was specifically established as the result of the concern that variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, as well as related viruses, might be utilized as biological weapons. In addition, the PBRC supports research on poxviruses that might be considered new and emerging infectious agents such as monkeypox virus. The PBRC consists of a relational database and web application that supports the data storage, annotation, analysis and information exchange goals of the project. The current release consists of over 35 complete genomic sequences of various genera, species and strains of viruses from the Poxviridae family. Sequence and annotation information for these viruses has been obtained from sequences publicly available from GenBank as well as sequences not yet deposited in GenBank that have been obtained from ongoing sequencing projects. In addition to sequence data, the PBRC provides comprehensive annotation and curation of virus genes; analytical tools to aid in the understanding of the available sequence data, including tools for the comparative analysis of different virus isolates; and visualization tools to help better display the results of various analyses. The PBRC represents the initial development of what will become a more comprehensive Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center for Biodefense that will be one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' 'Bioinformatics Resource Centers for Biodefense and Emerging or Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases'.

25860289	Characterizing the transmission potential of zoonotic infections from minor outbreaks	The transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004154	Kucharski AJ, Edmunds WJ.

24418545	Susceptibility of the wild-derived inbred CAST/Ei mouse to infection by orthopoxviruses analyzed by live bioluminescence imaging	Classical inbred mice are extensively used for virus research. However, we recently found that some wild-derived inbred mouse strains are more susceptible than classical strains to monkeypox virus. Experiments described here indicated that the 50% lethal dose of vaccinia virus (VACV) and cowpox virus (CPXV) were two logs lower in wild-derived inbred CAST/Ei mice than classical inbred BALB/c mice, whereas there was little difference in the susceptibility of the mouse strains to herpes simplex virus. Live bioluminescence imaging was used to follow spread of pathogenic and attenuated VACV strains and CPXV virus from nasal passages to organs in the chest and abdomen of CAST/Ei mice. Luminescence increased first in the head and then simultaneously in the chest and abdomen in a dose-dependent manner. The spreading kinetics was more rapid with VACV than CPXV although the peak photon flux was similar. These data suggest advantages of CAST/Ei mice for orthopoxvirus studies.	18	Information Unavailable	Cowpox virus pathogenesis; Poxvirus pathogenesis; Vaccinia virus pathogenesis; Wild-derived inbred mice	10.1016/j.virol.2013.11.017	Americo JL, Sood CL, Cotter CA, Vogel JL, Kristie TM, Moss B, Earl PL.

14506041	Efficacy of multiple- or single-dose cidofovir against vaccinia and cowpox virus infections in mice	Orthopoxviruses, including variola and monkeypox, pose risks to human health through natural transmission or potential bioterrorist activities. Since vaccination has not recently been utilized for control of these infections, there is renewed effort in the development of antiviral agents not only for postexposure smallpox therapy but also for treatment of adverse reactions following vaccination. The objectives of this study were to expand on the results of others that cidofovir (CDV) is effective in mice inoculated with cowpox virus (CV) or vaccinia virus (VV) and to document the efficacy of single and interval dosing beginning prior to or after infection, particularly including evaluations using suboptimal doses of CDV. We utilized BALB/c or SCID mice inoculated with CV or VV as models for systemic poxvirus infections. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with CV or VV and treated with CDV prior to or after virus inoculation. CDV, at concentrations as low as 0.7 to 6.7 mg/kg of body weight/day for 5 days, conferred significant protection when treatment was initiated as late as 72 to 96 h postinfection. A single-dose pretreatment or posttreatment with CDV at 3 to 100 mg/kg was effective when given as early as 5 days prior to infection or as late as 3 days after infection with either VV or CV. Interval treatments given every third day beginning 72 h postinfection using 6.7 or 2 mg of CDV/kg also proved effective against CV infections. When SCID mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with CV or VV and treated for 7 to 30 days with CDV, all the mice eventually died during or after cessation of treatment; however, significant delays in time to death and reduction of virus replication in organs occurred in most treated groups, and no resistance to CDV was detected.	27	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.47.10.3275-3280.2003	Quenelle DC, Collins DJ, Kern ER.

17499326	Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara provides durable protection against disease caused by an immunodeficiency virus as well as long-term immunity to an orthopoxvirus in a non-human primate	Recombinant and non-recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strains are currently in clinical trials as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and attenuated smallpox vaccines, respectively. Here we tested the ability of a recombinant MVA delivered by alternative needle-free routes (intramuscular, intradermal, or into the palatine tonsil) to protect against immunodeficiency and orthopoxvirus diseases in a non-human primate model. Rhesus macaques were immunized twice 1 month apart with MVA expressing 5 genes from a pathogenic simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)/89.6P and challenged intrarectally 9 months later with the pathogenic SHIV/89.6P and intravenously 2.7 years later with monkeypox virus. Irrespective of the route of vaccine delivery, binding and neutralizing antibodies and CD8 responses to SHIV and orthopoxvirus proteins were induced and the monkeys were successively protected against the diseases caused by the challenge viruses in unimmunized controls as determined by viral loads and clinical signs. These non-human primate studies support the clinical testing of recombinant MVA as an HIV vaccine and further demonstrate that MVA can provide long-term poxvirus immunity, essential for use as an alternative smallpox vaccine.	30	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2007.02.041	Earl PL, Americo JL, Wyatt LS, Eller LA, Montefiori DC, Byrum R, Piatak M, Lifson JD, Amara RR, Robinson HL, Huggins JW, Moss B.

11189723	Public health implications of emerging zoonoses	Many new, emerging and re-emerging diseases of humans are caused by pathogens which originate from animals or products of animal origin. A wide variety of animal species, both domestic and wild, act as reservoirs for these pathogens, which may be viruses, bacteria or parasites. Given the extensive distribution of the animal species affected, the effective surveillance, prevention and control of zoonotic diseases pose a significant challenge. The authors describe the direct and indirect implications for public health of emerging zoonoses. Direct implications are defined as the consequences for human health in terms of morbidity and mortality. Indirect implications are defined as the effect of the influence of emerging zoonotic disease on two groups of people, namely: health professionals and the general public. Professional assessment of the importance of these diseases influences public health practices and structures, the identification of themes for research and allocation of resources at both national and international levels. The perception of the general public regarding the risks involved considerably influences policy-making in the health field. Extensive outbreaks of zoonotic disease are not uncommon, especially as the disease is often not recognised as zoonotic at the outset and may spread undetected for some time. However, in many instances, the direct impact on health of these new, emerging or re-emerging zoonoses has been small compared to that of other infectious diseases affecting humans. To illustrate the tremendous indirect impact of emerging zoonotic diseases on public health policy and structures and on public perception of health risks, the authors provide a number of examples, including that of the Ebola virus, avian influenza, monkeypox and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Recent epidemics of these diseases have served as a reminder of the existence of infectious diseases and of the capacity of these diseases to occur unexpectedly in new locations and animal species. The need for greater international co-operation, better local, regional and global networks for communicable disease surveillance and pandemic planning is also illustrated by these examples. These diseases have contributed to the definition of new paradigms, especially relating to food safety policies and more generally to the protection of public health. Finally, the examples described emphasise the importance of intersectorial collaboration for disease containment, and of independence of sectorial interests and transparency when managing certain health risks.	16	Review	Information Unavailable	10.20506/rst.19.1.1214	Meslin FX, Stöhr K, Heymann D.

26700306	Evidence for Persistence of Ectromelia Virus in Inbred Mice, Recrudescence Following Immunosuppression and Transmission to Naïve Mice	Orthopoxviruses (OPV), including variola, vaccinia, monkeypox, cowpox and ectromelia viruses cause acute infections in their hosts. With the exception of variola virus (VARV), the etiological agent of smallpox, other OPV have been reported to persist in a variety of animal species following natural or experimental infection. Despite the implications and significance for the ecology and epidemiology of diseases these viruses cause, those reports have never been thoroughly investigated. We used the mouse pathogen ectromelia virus (ECTV), the agent of mousepox and a close relative of VARV to investigate virus persistence in inbred mice. We provide evidence that ECTV causes a persistent infection in some susceptible strains of mice in which low levels of virus genomes were detected in various tissues late in infection. The bone marrow (BM) and blood appeared to be key sites of persistence. Contemporaneous with virus persistence, antiviral CD8 T cell responses were demonstrable over the entire 25-week study period, with a change in the immunodominance hierarchy evident during the first 3 weeks. Some virus-encoded host response modifiers were found to modulate virus persistence whereas host genes encoded by the NKC and MHC class I reduced the potential for persistence. When susceptible strains of mice that had apparently recovered from infection were subjected to sustained immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (CTX), animals succumbed to mousepox with high titers of infectious virus in various organs. CTX treated index mice transmitted virus to, and caused disease in, co-housed naïve mice. The most surprising but significant finding was that immunosuppression of disease-resistant C57BL/6 mice several weeks after recovery from primary infection generated high titers of virus in multiple tissues. Resistant mice showed no evidence of a persistent infection. This is the strongest evidence that ECTV can persist in inbred mice, regardless of their resistance status.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005342	Sakala IG, Chaudhri G, Scalzo AA, Eldi P, Newsome TP, Buller RM, Karupiah G.

15147587	Multi-pathogens sequence containing plasmids as positive controls for universal detection of potential agents of bioterrorism	"Background: The limited circulation of many of the agents that are likely to be used in a bioterrorism attack precludes the ready availability of positive controls. This means that only specialized laboratories can screen for the presence of these agents by nucleic amplification assays. Calibrated controls are also necessary for quantitative measurements. Primers and probes to be used in both conventional and real-time PCR assays were designed for the detection of agents likely to be used by a bioterrorist. Three plasmids, each of which contains 4 to 6 specific sequences from agents on the CDC Category A and B list (excluding RNA viruses) were constructed. Two plasmids incorporate the sequences of Category A and B agents, respectively. The third plasmid incorporates sequences from Variola major and organisms that cause rash-like illnesses that may be clinically confused with smallpox. An ""exogenic sequence"", introducing a NotI restriction site was incorporated in the native sequences of the bioterrorism agents inserted in plasmids. The designed molecular system for detection of bioterrorism agents was tested on each of these agents (except Monkeypox virus, Smallpox virus and 2 Burkholderia species for which no native DNA was available) and a collection of 50 isolates of C. burnetii using constructed plasmids as positive controls. Results: Designed primers and probes allowed molecular detection, in either single or multiplex assays, of agent-specific targets with analytical sensitivities of between 1 and 100 DNA copies. The plasmids could be used as positive controls. False-positive results due to contamination by the positive control were easily detected by sequencing and eliminated by digestion with NotI. Conclusion: Plasmid A and B can be used as positive controls in molecular assays for the detection of bioterrorism agents in clinical specimens or environmental samples. Plasmid C can be used as a positive control in differentiation of vesicular rashes. It is also possible to avoid or to ensure immediate detection of false positive results due to contamination by positive controls using these plasmids. These plasmids and the corresponding primers and probes are immediately available for all clinical microbiology laboratories provided they have molecular amplification equipment."	11	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1471-2180-4-21	Charrel RN, La Scola B, Raoult D.

20067538	Vaccinia virus decreases major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, T-cell priming, and peptide association with MHC class II	Vaccinia virus (VACV) is the current live virus vaccine used to protect humans against smallpox and monkeypox, but its use is contraindicated in several populations because of its virulence. It is therefore important to elucidate the immune evasion mechanisms of VACV. We found that VACV infection of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) significantly decreased major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II antigen presentation and decreased synthesis of 13 chemokines and cytokines, suggesting a potent viral mechanism for immune evasion. In these model systems, responding T cells were not directly affected by virus, indicating that VACV directly affects the APC. VACV significantly decreased nitric oxide production by peritoneal exudate cells and the RAW macrophage cell line in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-gamma, decreased class II MHC expression on APCs, and induced apoptosis in macrophages and dendritic cells. However, VACV decreased antigen presentation by 1153 B cells without apparent apoptosis induction, indicating that VACV differentially affects B lymphocytes and other APCs. We show that the key mechanism of VACV inhibition of antigen presentation may be its reduction of antigenic peptide loaded into the cleft of MHC class II molecules. These data indicate that VACV evades the host immune response by impairing critical functions of the APC.	21	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03120.x	Rehm KE, Connor RF, Jones GJ, Yimbu K, Mannie MD, Roper RL.

14645836	Are we ready for pandemic influenza?	During the past year, the public has become keenly aware of the threat of emerging infectious diseases with the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the continuing threat of bioterrorism, the proliferation of West Nile virus, and the discovery of human cases of monkeypox in the United States. At the same time, an old foe has again raised its head, reminding us that our worst nightmare may not be a new one. In 2003, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, including the H5N1 and H7N7 subtypes, again crossed from birds to humans and caused fatal disease. Direct avian-to-human influenza transmission was unknown before 1997. Have we responded to these threats by better preparing for emerging disease agents, or are we continuing to act only as crises arise? Here we consider progress to date in preparedness for an influenza pandemic and review what remains to be done. We conclude by prioritizing the remaining needs and exploring the reasons for our current lack of preparedness for an influenza pandemic.	220	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1126/science.1090350	Webby RJ, Webster RG.

32979762	Human and murine memory γδ T cells: Evidence for acquired immune memory in bacterial and viral infections and autoimmunity	γδ T cells are unconventional lymphocytes that could play a role in bridging the innate and adaptive immune system. Upon initial exposure to an antigen, some activated T cells become memory T cells that could be reactivated upon secondary immune challenge. Recently, subsets of γδ T cells with a restricted antigen repertoire and long-term persistence have been observed after clearance of viral and bacterial infections. These γδ T cells possess the hallmark ability of memory T cells to respond more strongly and proliferate to a higher extent upon secondary infection. Murine and primate models of Listeria monocytogenes and cytomegalovirus infection display these memory hallmarks and demonstrate γδ T cell memory responses. In addition, human and non-human primate infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as non-human primate infection with monkeypox and studies on patients suffering from autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis) reveal memory-like responses corresponding with disease. Murine models of psoriatic disease (imiquimod) and parasite infections (malaria) exhibited shifts to memory phenotypes with repeated immune challenge. These studies provide strong support for the formation of immune memory in γδ T cells, and memory γδ T cells may have a widespread role in protective immunity and autoimmunity.	3	Review	Adaptive immunity; Autoimmunity; Gamma delta T cell; Immune memory; Infections	10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104217	Comeau K, Paradis P, Schiffrin EL.

34469446	News media narratives of Covid-19 across 20 countries: Early global convergence and later regional divergence	Background: Seldom in history does one get a 'front row seat'-with large-scale dynamic data-on how online news media narratives shift with a global pandemic. News media narratives matter because they shape societal perceptions and influence the core tent poles of our society, from the economy to elections. Given its importance-and with the benefit of hindsight-we provide a systematic framework to analyze news narratives of Covid-19, laying the groundwork to evaluate policy and risk communications. Objectives: We leverage a 10-billion-word-database of online news, taken from over 7,000 English newspapers and magazines across 20 countries, culminating in 28 million articles. First, we track the volume of Covid-19 conversations across 20 countries from before to during the pandemic (Oct'19 to May'20). Second, we distill the phases of global pandemic narratives, and elucidate regional differences. Methods: To track the volume of Covid-19 narratives, we identified 10 target terms-Coronavirus, Covid-19, Covid, nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan Virus, Virus, Disease, Epidemic, Pandemic-and tracked their combined monthly prevalence across eight months from October 2019 through May 2020. Globally, across 20 countries, we identified 18,042,855 descriptors of the target terms. Further, these descriptors were analysed with natural language processing models to generate the top five topics of Covid-19 that were labelled by two independent researchers. This process was repeated across six continents to distil regional topics. Results: Our model found four phases of online news media narratives: Pre-pandemic, Early, Peak and Recovery. Pre-pandemic narratives (Oct'19-Dec'19) were divergent across regions with Africa focused on monkeypox, Asia on dengue fever, and North America on Lyme disease and AIDS. Early (Jan-Feb'20) and Peak Pandemic (Mar-May'20) evidenced a global convergence, reflecting the omnipresence of Covid-19. The brief transition from early to peak pandemic narratives underscored the pandemic's rapid spread. Emerging from the embers of the pandemic's peak were nascent recovery words that are regionally divergent-Oceania focused on hope and an uncertain future while North America centered on re-opening the economy and tackling discrimination. Conclusions: Practically, we presented a media barometer of Covid-19, and provided a framework to analyse the pandemic's impact on societal perceptions-laying the important groundwork for policy makers to evaluate policy communications, and design risk communication strategies.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0256358	Ng R, Chow TYJ, Yang W.

33692745	Neurologic Manifestations of the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases	The World Health Organization (WHO) monitors the spread of diseases globally and maintains a list of diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. Currently listed diseases include Chikungunya, cholera, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Hendra virus infection, influenza, Lassa fever, Marburg virus disease, Neisseria meningitis, MERS-CoV, monkeypox, Nipah virus infection, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), plague, Rift Valley fever, SARS, smallpox, tularemia, yellow fever, and Zika virus disease. The associated pathogens are increasingly important on the global stage. The majority of these diseases have neurological manifestations. Those with less frequent neurological manifestations may also have important consequences. This is highlighted now in particular through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reinforces that pathogens with the potential to spread rapidly and widely, in spite of concerted global efforts, may affect the nervous system. We searched the scientific literature, dating from 1934 to August 2020, to compile data on the cause, epidemiology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging features, and treatment of each of the diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential as viewed through a neurologist's lens. We included articles with an abstract or full text in English in this topical and scoping review. Diseases with epidemic and pandemic potential can be spread directly from human to human, animal to human, via mosquitoes or other insects, or via environmental contamination. Manifestations include central neurologic conditions (meningitis, encephalitis, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, seizures), peripheral and cranial nerve syndromes (sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, ophthalmoplegia), post-infectious syndromes (acute inflammatory polyneuropathy), and congenital syndromes (fetal microcephaly), among others. Some diseases have not been well-characterized from a neurological standpoint, but all have at least scattered case reports of neurological features. Some of the diseases have curative treatments available while in other cases, supportive care remains the only management option. Regardless of the pathogen, prompt, and aggressive measures to control the spread of these agents are the most important factors in lowering the overall morbidity and mortality they can cause.	3	Review	clinical neurology; epidemic; neuroviral epidemics; pandemic; tropical medicine	10.3389/fneur.2021.634827	McEntire CRS, Song KW, McInnis RP, Rhee JY, Young M, Williams E, Wibecan LL, Nolan N, Nagy AM, Gluckstein J, Mukerji SS, Mateen FJ.

32320436	Natural killer cells expanded in vivo or ex vivo with IL-15 overcomes the inherent susceptibility of CAST mice to lethal infection with orthopoxviruses	The wild-derived inbred CAST/EiJ mouse, one of eight founder strains in the Collaborative Cross panel, is an exceptional model for studying monkeypox virus (MPXV), an emerging human pathogen, and other orthopoxviruses including vaccinia virus (VACV). Previous studies suggested that the extreme susceptibility of the CAST mouse to orthopoxviruses is due to an insufficient innate immune response. Here, we focused on the low number of natural killer (NK) cells in the naïve CAST mouse as a contributing factor to this condition. Administration of IL-15 to CAST mice transiently increased NK and CD8+ T cells that could express IFN-γ, indicating that the progenitor cells were capable of responding to cytokines. However, the number of NK cells rapidly declined indicating a defect in their homeostasis. Furthermore, IL-15-treated mice were protected from an otherwise lethal challenge with VACV or MPXV. IL-15 decreased virus spread and delayed death even when CD4+/CD8+ T cells were depleted with antibody, supporting an early protective role of the expanded NK cells. Purified splenic NK cells from CAST mice proliferated in vitro in response to IL-15 and could be activated with IL-12/IL-18 to secrete interferon-γ. Passive transfer of non-activated or activated CAST NK cells reduced VACV spread but only the latter completely prevented death at the virus dose used. Moreover, antibodies to interferon-γ abrogated the protection by activated NK cells. Thus, the inherent susceptibility of CAST mice to orthopoxviruses can be explained by a low level of NK cells and this vulnerability can be overcome either by expanding their NK cells in vivo with IL-15 or by passive transfer of purified NK cells that were expanded and activated in vitro.	3	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1008505	Earl PL, Americo JL, Moss B.

12904397	Real-time PCR assay to detect smallpox virus	We developed a highly sensitive and specific assay for the rapid detection of smallpox virus DNA on both the Smart Cycler and LightCycler platforms. The assay is based on TaqMan chemistry with the orthopoxvirus hemagglutinin gene used as the target sequence. With genomic DNA purified from variola virus Bangladesh 1975, the limit of detection was estimated to be approximately 25 copies on both machines. The assay was evaluated in a blinded study with 322 coded samples that included genomic DNA from 48 different isolates of variola virus; 25 different strains and isolates of camelpox, cowpox, ectromelia, gerbilpox, herpes, monkeypox, myxoma, rabbitpox, raccoonpox, skunkpox, vaccinia, and varicella-zoster viruses; and two rickettsial species at concentrations mostly ranging from 100 fg/ microl to 1 ng/ microl. Contained within those 322 samples were variola virus DNA, obtained from purified viral preparations, at concentrations of 1 fg/ microl to 1 ng/ microl. On the Smart Cycler platform, 2 samples with false-positive results were detected among the 116 samples not containing variola virus tested; i.e., the overall specificity of the assay was 98.3%. On the LightCycler platform, five samples with false-positive results were detected (overall specificity, 95.7%). Of the 206 samples that contained variola virus DNA ranging in concentrations from 100 fg/ microl to 1 ng/ microl, 8 samples were considered negative on the Smart Cycler platform and 1 sample was considered negative on the LightCycler platform. Thus, the clinical sensitivities were 96.1% for the Smart Cycler instrument and 99.5% for the LightCycler instrument. The vast majority of these samples were derived from virus-infected cell cultures and variola virus-infected tissues; thus, the DNA material contained both viral DNA and cellular DNA. Of the 43 samples that contained purified variola virus DNA ranging in concentration from 1 fg/ microl to 1 ng/ microl, the assay correctly detected the virus in all 43 samples on both the Smart Cycler and the LightCycler platforms. The assay may be useful for the early detection of smallpox virus infections should such infections occur as a result of a deliberate or an accidental recurrence.	27	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JCM.41.8.3835-3839.2003	Sofi Ibrahim M, Kulesh DA, Saleh SS, Damon IK, Esposito JJ, Schmaljohn AL, Jahrling PB.

32019881	Repair of a previously uncharacterized second host-range gene contributes to full replication of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) in human cells	Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a widely used vaccine vector for expression of genes of unrelated pathogens, is safe, immunogenic, and can incorporate large amounts of added DNA. MVA was derived by extensively passaging the chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara (CVA) vaccine strain in chicken embryo fibroblasts during which numerous mutations and deletions occurred with loss of replicative ability in most mammalian cells. Restoration of the deleted C12L gene, encoding serine protease inhibitor 1, enhances replication of MVA in human MRC-5 cells but only slightly in other human cells. Here we show that repair of the inactivated C16L/B22R gene of MVA enhances replication in numerous human cell lines. This previously uncharacterized gene is present at both ends of the genome of many orthopoxviruses and is highly conserved in most, including smallpox and monkeypox viruses. The C16L/B22R gene is expressed early in infection from the second methionine of the previously annotated Copenhagen strain open reading frame (ORF) as a 17.4-kDa protein. The C16/B22 and C12 proteins together promote MVA replication in human cells to levels that are comparable to titers in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Both proteins enhance virion assembly, but C16/B22 increases proteolytic processing of core proteins in A549 cells consistent with higher infectious virus titers. Furthermore, human A549 cells expressing codon-optimized C16L/B22R and C12L genes support higher levels of MVA replication than cell lines expressing neither or either alone. Identification of the genes responsible for the host-range defect of MVA may allow more rational engineering of vaccines for efficacy, safety, and propagation.	8	Information Unavailable	host range; poxvirus; vaccine vector; vaccinia virus	10.1073/pnas.1921098117	Peng C, Moss B.

23596297	The mature virion of ectromelia virus, a pathogenic poxvirus, is capable of intrahepatic spread and can serve as a target for delayed therapy	Orthopoxviruses (OPVs), which include the agent of smallpox (variola virus), the zoonotic monkeypox virus, the vaccine and zoonotic species vaccinia virus, and the mouse pathogen ectromelia virus (ECTV), form two types of infectious viral particles: the mature virus (MV), which is cytosolic, and the enveloped virus (EV), which is extracellular. It is believed that MVs are required for viral entry into the host, while EVs are responsible for spread within the host. Following footpad infection of susceptible mice, ECTV spreads lymphohematogenously, entering the liver at 3 to 4 days postinfection (dpi). Afterwards, ECTV spreads intrahepatically, killing the host. We found that antibodies to an MV protein were highly effective at curing mice from ECTV infection when administered after the virus reached the liver. Moreover, a mutant ECTV that does not make EV was able to spread intrahepatically and kill immunodeficient mice. Together, these findings indicate that MVs are sufficient for the spread of ECTV within the liver and could have implications regarding the pathogenesis of other OPVs, the treatment of emerging OPV infections, as well as strategies for preparedness in case of accidental or intentional release of pathogenic OPVs.

19307376	Inhibition of vaccinia virus replication by two small interfering RNAs targeting B1R and G7L genes and their synergistic combination with cidofovir	In view of the threat of the potential use of variola virus in a terrorist attack, considerable efforts have been performed to develop new antiviral strategies against orthopoxviruses. Here we report on the use of RNA interference, either alone or in combination with cidofovir, as an approach to inhibit orthopoxvirus replication. Two selected small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), named siB1R-2 and siG7L-1, and a previously reported siRNA, i.e., siD5R-2 (which targets the viral D5R mRNA), were evaluated for antiviral activity against vaccinia virus (VACV) by plaque reduction and virus yield assays. siB1R-2 and siG7L-1, administered before or after viral infection, reduced VACV replication by more than 90%. Also, these two siRNAs decreased monkeypox virus replication by 95% at a concentration of 1 nM. siB1R-2 and siG7L-1 were demonstrated to specifically silence their corresponding transcripts, i.e., B1R and G7L mRNAs, without induction of a beta interferon response. Strong synergistic effects were observed when siB1R-2, siG7L-1, or siD5R-2 was combined with cidofovir. In addition, the antiviral activities of these three siRNAs were evaluated against VACV resistant to cidofovir and other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates. siG7L-1 and siD5R-2 remained active against four of five VACV mutants, while siB1R-2 showed activity against only one of the mutants. Our results showed that siRNAs are potent inhibitory agents in vitro, not only against wild-type VACV but also against several cidofovir-resistant VACV. Furthermore, we showed that a combined therapy using siRNA and cidofovir may be useful in the treatment of poxvirus infections.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/AAC.01626-08	Vigne S, Duraffour S, Andrei G, Snoeck R, Garin D, Crance JM.

19667214	Emerging viral infections of the central nervous system: part 1	In this 2-part review, I will focus on emerging virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Part 1 will introduce the basic features of emerging infections, including their definition, epidemiology, and the frequency of CNS involvement. Important mechanisms of emergence will be reviewed, including viruses spreading into new host ranges as exemplified by West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, Toscana virus, and enterovirus 71 (EV71). Emerging infections also result from opportunistic spread of viruses into known niches, often resulting from attenuated host resistance to infection. This process is exemplified by transplant-associated cases of viral CNS infection caused by WNV, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis-like viruses and by the syndrome of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6)-associated posttransplantation acute limbic encephalitis. The second part of this review begins with a discussion of JC virus and the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in association with novel immunomodulatory therapies and then continues with an overview of the risk of infection introduced by imported animals (eg, monkeypox virus) and examples of emerging diseases caused by enhanced competence of viruses for vectors and the spread of vectors (eg, chikungunya virus) and then concludes with examples of novel viruses causing CNS infection as exemplified by Nipah and Hendra viruses and bat lyssaviruses.	39	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1001/archneurol.2009.153	Tyler KL.

18226434	Immune responses to the smallpox vaccine given in combination with ST-246, a small-molecule inhibitor of poxvirus dissemination	"The re-emerging threat of smallpox and the emerging threat of monkeypox highlight the need for effective poxvirus countermeasures. Currently approved smallpox vaccines have unacceptable safety profiles and, consequently, the general populace is no longer vaccinated, leading to an increasingly susceptible population. ST-246, a small-molecule inhibitor of poxvirus dissemination, has been demonstrated in various animal models to be safe and effective in preventing poxviral disease. This suggests that it may also be used to improve the safety of the traditional smallpox vaccine provided that it does not inhibit vaccine-induced protective immunity. In this study, we compared the immune responses elicited by the smallpox vaccine alone or in combination with ST-246 in mice. Normal lesion formation following dermal scarification with the attenuated New York City Board of Health strain (Dryvax), commonly referred to as a vaccine ""take"", was not inhibited although severe lesions and systemic disease due to vaccination with the virulent Western Reserve (VV-WR) strain were prevented. The vaccine given with ST-246 did not affect cellular immune responses or neutralizing antibody titers although anti-vaccinia ELISA titers were slightly reduced. Vaccination in combination with ST-246 provided equivalent short- and long-term protection against lethal intranasal challenge with VV-WR when compared to vaccine alone. These results suggest that ST-246 does not compromise protective immunity elicited by the vaccine and provide the basis for future studies examining the efficacy of ST-246 in preventing or treating adverse events due to vaccination."	15	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.11.095	Grosenbach DW, Jordan R, King DS, Berhanu A, Warren TK, Kirkwood-Watts DL, Tyavanagimatt S, Tan Y, Wilson RL, Jones KF, Hruby DE.

22826318	CD8 T cells are essential for recovery from a respiratory vaccinia virus infection	The precise immune components required for protection against a respiratory Orthopoxvirus infection, such as human smallpox or monkeypox, remain to be fully identified. In this study, we used the virulent Western Reserve strain of vaccinia virus (VACV-WR) to model a primary respiratory Orthopoxvirus infection. Naive mice infected with VACV-WR mounted an early CD8 T cell response directed against dominant and subdominant VACV-WR Ags, followed by a CD4 T cell and Ig response. In contrast to other VACV-WR infection models that highlight the critical requirement for CD4 T cells and Ig, we found that only mice deficient in CD8 T cells presented with severe cachexia, pulmonary inflammation, viral dissemination, and 100% mortality. Depletion of CD8 T cells at specified times throughout infection highlighted that they perform their critical function between days 4 and 6 postinfection and that their protective requirement is critically dictated by initial viral load and virulence. Finally, the ability of adoptively transferred naive CD8 T cells to protect RAG⁻/⁻ mice against a lethal VACV-WR infection demonstrated that they are both necessary and sufficient in protecting against a primary VACV-WR infection of the respiratory tract.	25	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.4049/jimmunol.1200799	Goulding J, Bogue R, Tahiliani V, Croft M, Salek-Ardakani S.

20961593	The identification of HLA class II-restricted T cell epitopes to vaccinia virus membrane proteins	Three decades after the eradication of smallpox, the threat of bioterrorism and outbreaks of emerging diseases such as monkeypox have renewed interest in the development of safe and effective next-generation poxvirus vaccines and biodefense research. Current smallpox vaccines contain live virus and are contraindicated for a large percentage of the population. Safer, yet still effective inactivated and subunit vaccines are needed, and epitope identification is an essential step in the development of these subunit vaccines. In this study we focused on 4 vaccinia membrane proteins known to be targeted by humoral responses in vaccinees. In spite of the narrow focus of the study we identified 36T cell epitopes, and provide additional support for the physical linkage between T and B epitopes. This information may prove useful in peptide and protein-based subunit vaccine development as well as in the study of CD4 responses to poxviruses.	9	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2010.09.013	Kennedy RB, Poland GA.

12388681	Identification of the orthopoxvirus p4c gene, which encodes a structural protein that directs intracellular mature virus particles into A-type inclusions	The orthopoxvirus gene p4c has been identified in the genome of the vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve. This gene encodes the 58-kDa structural protein P4c present on the surfaces of the intracellular mature virus (IMV) particles. The gene is disrupted in the genome of cowpox virus Brighton Red (BR), demonstrating that although the P4c protein may be advantageous for virus replication in vivo, it is not essential for virus replication in vitro. Complementation and recombination analyses with the p4c gene have shown that the P4c protein is required to direct the IMV into the A-type inclusions (ATIs) produced by cowpox virus BR. The p4c gene is highly conserved among most members of the orthopoxvirus genus, including viruses that produce ATIs, such as cowpox, ectromelia, and raccoonpox viruses, as well as those such as variola, monkeypox, vaccinia, and camelpox viruses, which do not. The conservation of the p4c gene among the orthopoxviruses, irrespective of their capacities to produce ATIs, suggests that the P4c protein provides functions in addition to that of directing IMV into ATIs. These findings, and the presence of the P4c protein in IMV but not extracellular enveloped virus (D. Ulaeto, D. Grosenbach, and D. E. Hruby, J. Virol. 70:3372-3377, 1996), suggest a model in which the P4c protein may play a role in the retrograde movement of IMV particles, thereby contributing to the retention of IMV particles within the cytoplasm and within ATIs when they are present. In this way, the P4c protein may affect both viral morphogenesis and processes of virus dissemination.	29	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/jvi.76.22.11216-11225.2002	McKelvey TA, Andrews SC, Miller SE, Ray CA, Pickup DJ.

23133652	Protection of rabbits and immunodeficient mice against lethal poxvirus infections by human monoclonal antibodies	Smallpox (variola virus) is a bioweapon concern. Monkeypox is a growing zoonotic poxvirus threat. These problems have resulted in extensive efforts to develop potential therapeutics that can prevent or treat potentially lethal poxvirus infections in humans. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against smallpox are a conservative approach to this problem, as the licensed human smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus, VACV) primarily works on the basis of protective antibody responses against smallpox. Fully human mAbs (hmAbs) against vaccinia H3 (H3L) and B5 (B5R), targeting both the mature virion (MV) and extracellular enveloped virion (EV) forms, have been developed as potential therapeutics for use in humans. Post-exposure prophylaxis was assessed in both murine and rabbit animal models. Therapeutic efficacy of the mAbs was assessed in three good laboratory practices (GLP) studies examining severe combined immunodeficiency mice (SCID) given a lethal VACV infection. Pre-exposure combination hmAb therapy provided significantly better protection against disease and death than either single hmAb or vaccinia immune globulin (VIG). Post-exposure combination mAb therapy provided significant protection against disease and death, and appeared to fully cure the VACV infection in ≥50% of SCID mice. Therapeutic efficacy was then assessed in two rabbit studies examining post-exposure hmAb prophylaxis against rabbitpox (RPXV). In the first study, rabbits were infected with RPVX and then provided hmAbs at 48 hrs post-infection, or 1 hr and 72 hrs post-infection. Rabbits in both groups receiving hmAbs were 100% protected from death. In the second rabbitpox study, 100% of animal treated with combination hmAb therapy and 100% of animals treated with anti-B5 hmAb were protected. These findings suggest that combination hmAb treatment may be effective at controlling smallpox disease in immunocompetent or immunodeficient humans.	5	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0048706	Crickard L, Babas T, Seth S, Silvera P, Koriazova L, Crotty S.

23006741	Epitope mapping by random peptide phage display reveals essential residues for vaccinia extracellular enveloped virion spread	Background: A33 is a type II integral membrane protein expressed on the extracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus (VACV). Passive transfer of A33-directed monoclonal antibodies or vaccination with an A33 subunit vaccine confers protection against lethal poxvirus challenge in animal models. Homologs of A33 are highly conserved among members of the Orthopoxvirus genus and are potential candidates for inclusion in vaccines or assays targeting extracellular enveloped virus activity. One monoclonal antibody directed against VACV A33, MAb-1G10, has been shown to target a conformation-dependent epitope. Interestingly, while it recognizes VACV A33 as well as the corresponding variola homolog, it does not bind to the monkeypox homolog. In this study, we utilized a random phage display library to investigate the epitope recognized by MAb-1G10 that is critical for facilitating cell-to-cell spread of the vaccinia virus. Results: By screening with linear or conformational random phage libraries, we found that phages binding to MAb-1G10 display the consensus motif CEPLC, with a disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues required for MAb-1G10 binding. Although the phage motif contained no linear sequences homologous to VACV A33, structure modeling and analysis suggested that residue D115 is important to form the minimal epitope core. A panel of point mutants expressing the ectodomain of A33 protein was generated and analyzed by either binding assays such as ELISA and immunoprecipitation or a functional assessment by blocking MAb-1G10 mediated comet inhibition in cell culture. Conclusions: These results confirm L118 as a component of the MAb-1G10 binding epitope, and further identify D115 as an essential residue. By defining the minimum conformational structure, as well as the conformational arrangement of a short peptide sequence recognized by MAb-1G10, these results introduce the possibility of designing small molecule mimetics that may interfere with the function of A33 in vivo. This information will also be useful for designing improved assays to evaluate the potency of monoclonal and polyclonal products that target A33 or A33-modulated EV dissemination.	6	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-9-217	He Y, Wang Y, Struble EB, Zhang P, Chowdhury S, Reed JL, Kennedy M, Scott DE, Fisher RW.

33965861	Adamantane derivatives as potential inhibitors of p37 major envelope protein and poxvirus reproduction. Design, synthesis and antiviral activity	Currently, smallpox, caused by the variola virus belonging to the poxvirus family, has been completely eradicated according to the WHO. However, other representatives of poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, ectromelia virus, monkeypox virus, mousepox virus and others, remain in the natural environment and can infect both animals and humans. The pathogens of animal diseases, belonging to the category with a high epidemic risk, have already caused several outbreaks among humans, and can, in an unfavorable combination of circumstances, cause not only an epidemic, but also a pandemic. Despite the fact that there are protocols for the treatment of poxvirus infections, the targeted design of new drugs will increase their availability and expand the arsenal of antiviral chemotherapeutic agents. One of the potential targets of poxviruses is the p37 protein, which is a tecovirimat target. This protein is relatively small, has no homologs among proteins of humans and other mammals and is necessary for the replication of viral particles, which makes it attractive target for virtual screening. Using the I-TASSER modelling and molecular dynamics refinement the p37 orthopox virus protein model was obtained and its was confirmed by ramachandran plot analysis and superimposition of the model with the template protein with similar function. A virtual library of adamantane containing compounds was generated and a number of potential inhibitors were chosen from virtual library using molecular docking. Several compounds bearing adamantane moiety were synthesized and their biological activity was tested in vitro on vaccinia, cowpox and mousepox viruses. The new compounds inhibiting vaccinia virus replication with IC50 concentrations between 0.133 and 0.515 μM were found as a result of the research. The applied approach can be useful in the search of new inhibitors of orthopox reproduction. The proposed approach may be suitable for the design of new poxvirus inhibitors containing cage structural moiety.

22860117	Side-by-side comparison of gene-based smallpox vaccine with MVA in nonhuman primates	Orthopoxviruses remain a threat as biological weapons and zoonoses. The licensed live-virus vaccine is associated with serious health risks, making its general usage unacceptable. Attenuated vaccines are being developed as alternatives, the most advanced of which is modified-vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). We previously developed a gene-based vaccine, termed 4pox, which targets four orthopoxvirus antigens, A33, B5, A27 and L1. This vaccine protects mice and non-human primates from lethal orthopoxvirus disease. Here, we investigated the capacity of the molecular adjuvants GM-CSF and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) to enhance the efficacy of the 4pox gene-based vaccine. Both adjuvants significantly increased protective antibody responses in mice. We directly compared the 4pox plus LT vaccine against MVA in a monkeypox virus (MPXV) nonhuman primate (NHP) challenge model. NHPs were vaccinated twice with MVA by intramuscular injection or the 4pox/LT vaccine delivered using a disposable gene gun device. As a positive control, one NHP was vaccinated with ACAM2000. NHPs vaccinated with each vaccine developed anti-orthopoxvirus antibody responses, including those against the 4pox antigens. After MPXV intravenous challenge, all control NHPs developed severe disease, while the ACAM2000 vaccinated animal was well protected. All NHPs vaccinated with MVA were protected from lethality, but three of five developed severe disease and all animals shed virus. All five NHPs vaccinated with 4pox/LT survived and only one developed severe disease. None of the 4pox/LT-vaccinated animals shed virus. Our findings show, for the first time, that a subunit orthopoxvirus vaccine delivered by the same schedule can provide a degree of protection at least as high as that of MVA.	11	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0042353	Golden JW, Josleyn M, Mucker EM, Hung CF, Loudon PT, Wu TC, Hooper JW.

21933385	Polyclonal antibody cocktails generated using DNA vaccine technology protect in murine models of orthopoxvirus disease	Background: Previously we demonstrated that DNA vaccination of nonhuman primates (NHP) with a small subset of vaccinia virus (VACV) immunogens (L1, A27, A33, B5) protects against lethal monkeypox virus challenge. The L1 and A27 components of this vaccine target the mature virion (MV) whereas A33 and B5 target the enveloped virion (EV). Results: Here, we demonstrated that the antibodies produced in vaccinated NHPs were sufficient to confer protection in a murine model of lethal Orthopoxvirus infection. We further explored the concept of using DNA vaccine technology to produce immunogen-specific polyclonal antibodies that could then be combined into cocktails as potential immunoprophylactic/therapeutics. Specifically, we used DNA vaccines delivered by muscle electroporation to produce polyclonal antibodies against the L1, A27, A33, and B5 in New Zealand white rabbits. The polyclonal antibodies neutralized both MV and EV in cell culture. The ability of antibody cocktails consisting of anti-MV, anti-EV, or a combination of anti-MV/EV to protect BALB/c mice was evaluated as was the efficacy of the anti-MV/EV mixture in a mouse model of progressive vaccinia. In addition to evaluating weight loss and lethality, bioimaging technology was used to characterize the spread of the VACV infections in mice. We found that the anti-EV cocktail, but not the anti-MV cocktail, limited virus spread and lethality. Conclusions: A combination of anti-MV/EV antibodies was significantly more protective than anti-EV antibodies alone. These data suggest that DNA vaccine technology could be used to produce a polyclonal antibody cocktail as a possible product to replace vaccinia immune globulin.	7	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1186/1743-422X-8-441	Golden JW, Zaitseva M, Kapnick S, Fisher RW, Mikolajczyk MG, Ballantyne J, Golding H, Hooper JW.

17548517	Zoonotic orthopoxviruses encode a high-affinity antagonist of NKG2D	NK and T lymphocytes express both activating and inhibiting receptors for various members of the major histocompatibility complex class I superfamily (MHCISF). To evade immunologic cytotoxicity, many viruses interfere with the function of these receptors, generally by altering the displayed profile of MHCISF proteins on host cells. Using a structurally constrained hidden Markov model, we discovered an orthopoxvirus protein, itself distantly class I-like, that acts as a competitive antagonist of the NKG2D activating receptor. This orthopoxvirus MHC class I-like protein (OMCP) is conserved among cowpox and monkeypox viruses, secreted by infected cells, and bound with high affinity by NKG2D of rodents and humans (K(D) approximately 30 and 0.2 nM, respectively). OMCP blocks recognition of host-encoded ligands and inhibits NKG2D-dependent killing by NK cells. This finding represents a novel mechanism for viral interference with NKG2D and sheds light on intercellular recognition events underlying innate immunity against emerging orthopoxviruses.	44	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1084/jem.20062026	Campbell JA, Trossman DS, Yokoyama WM, Carayannopoulos LN.

23115291	Crystal structure of the cowpox virus-encoded NKG2D ligand OMCP	The NKG2D receptor is expressed on the surface of NK, T, and macrophage lineage cells and plays an important role in antiviral and antitumor immunity. To evade NKG2D recognition, herpesviruses block the expression of NKG2D ligands on the surface of infected cells using a diverse repertoire of sabotage methods. Cowpox and monkeypox viruses have taken an alternate approach by encoding a soluble NKG2D ligand, the orthopoxvirus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like protein (OMCP), which can block NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. This approach has the advantage of targeting a single conserved receptor instead of numerous host ligands that exhibit significant sequence diversity. Here, we show that OMCP binds the NKG2D homodimer as a monomer and competitively blocks host ligand engagement. We have also determined the 2.25-Å-resolution crystal structure of OMCP from the cowpox virus Brighton Red strain, revealing a truncated MHC class I-like platform domain consisting of a beta sheet flanked with two antiparallel alpha helices. OMCP is generally similar in structure to known host NKG2D ligands but has notable variations in regions typically used to engage NKG2D. Additionally, the determinants responsible for the 14-fold-higher affinity of OMCP for human than for murine NKG2D were mapped to a single loop in the NKG2D ligand-binding pocket.	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.01948-12	Lazear E, Peterson LW, Nelson CA, Fremont DH.

12815205	Comparative effects of cidofovir and cyclic HPMPC on lethal cowpox and vaccinia virus respiratory infections in mice	Background: Cidofovir is approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in humans. Although highly effective, the drug can cause renal toxicity in patients. There is much interest in cidofovir as a potential treatment for smallpox, monkeypox and other orthopoxvirus infections. A cyclic phosphonate form of cidofovir, 1-[((S)-2-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,4,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)methyl]cytosine (cyclic HPMPC), was reported to be less nephrotoxic than cidofovir in animals. Thus, it was deemed important to directly compare the activities of cidofovir and cyclic HPMPC against poxvirus infections in mouse models. Methods: The compounds were evaluated by intraperitoneal and intranasal infection routes using multiple doses of each agent, with single doses of compound given 24 h after virus challenge. Results: By intraperitoneal route, cidofovir protected mice from mortality at 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg, whereas cyclic HPMPC was similarly protective only at 160 mg/kg. By intranasal route, cidofovir was active down to 5 mg/kg, compared to cyclic HPMPC efficacy at 20 and 40 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal doses of 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg cidofovir significantly reduced mortality from vaccinia virus infections, compared to doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg cyclic HPMPC. Intranasal treatment with cidofovir at 5-40 mg/kg was comparably effective to cyclic HPMPC doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg in vaccinia virus infections. Active doses significantly reduced lung virus titers and lung consolidation. Overall, the potency of cyclic HPMPC was about 4 times less than that of cidofovir. Conclusions: Although cyclic HPMPC is reported to exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity in vivo, it is also less potent than cidofovir against orthopoxvirus infections. For this reason, cyclic HPMPC may not offer any advantage over cidofovir in treating these infections in humans.	7	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1159/000070618	Smee DF, Bailey KW, Sidwell RW.

32747299	Identification of protective T-cell antigens for smallpox vaccines	Background aims: E3L is an immediate-early protein of vaccinia virus (VV) that is detected within 0.5 h of infection, potentially before the many immune evasion genes of vaccinia can exert their protective effects. E3L is highly conserved among orthopoxviruses and hence could provide important protective T-cell epitopes that should be retained in any subunit or attenuated vaccine. We have therefore evaluated the immunogenicity of E3L in healthy VV-vaccinated donors. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers (n = 13) who had previously received a smallpox vaccine (Dryvax) were activated and expanded using overlapping E3L peptides and their function, specificity and antiviral activity was analyzed. E3L-specific T cells were expanded from 7 of 12 (58.3%) vaccinated healthy donors. Twenty-five percent of these produced CD8+ T-cell responses and 87.5% produced CD4+ T cells. We identified epitopes restricted by HLA-B35 and HLA-DR15. Results: E3L-specific T cells killed peptide-loaded target cells as well as vaccinia-infected cells, but only CD8+ T cells could prevent the spread of infectious virus in virus inhibition assays. The epitopes recognized by E3L-specific T cells were shared with monkeypox, and although there was a single amino acid change in the variola epitope homolog, it was recognized by vaccinia-specific T-cells. Conclusions: It might be important to include E3L in any deletion mutant or subunit vaccine and E3L could provide a useful antigen to monitor protective immunity in humans.	1	Information Unavailable	E3L; smallpox; vaccinia virus (VV); variola virus; virus-specific T cells	10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.04.098	Ando J, Ngo MC, Ando M, Leen A, Rooney CM.

19100593	Mousepox in the C57BL/6 strain provides an improved model for evaluating anti-poxvirus therapies	The intranasal lethal mousepox model employing the A/Ncr mouse strain is used to evaluate anti-orthopoxvirus therapies. These infections mimic large droplet transmission and result in 100% mortality within 7-10 days with as little as 1 PFU of ectromelia virus. Unlike the A/Ncr model, humans are less susceptible to lethal respiratory infections with variola virus and monkeypox virus as demonstrated by their lower mortality rates. In this study we show that a low dose intranasal infection of C57BL/6 mice results in 60-80% mortality and better models smallpox. Comparing CMX001 (HDP-cidofovir) efficacy in the A/Ncr strain and the C57BL/6 strain revealed that delayed treatment with CMX001 is more efficacious at preventing severe disease in the C57BL/6 strain. The increased efficacy of CMX001 in C57BL/6 over A/Ncr following an intranasal infection with ectromelia appears to be mediated by a stronger Th1 cell mediated response. Following footpad infection we show that the C57BL/6 strain has earlier and more robust transcriptional activity, Th1 cytokine secretions, antigen presenting activity and IFNgamma splenic CD8+ T cell responses as compared to the A/Ncr strain. As a result of the enhanced immune response in the C57BL/6 strain, non-lethal intradermal ectromelia infections can therapeutically protect up to 3 days following a homologous, lethal intranasal infection - much like how smallpox vaccination can protect humans for up to 4 days following intranasal variola infection.	28	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.virol.2008.11.015	Parker S, Siddiqui AM, Oberle C, Hembrador E, Lanier R, Painter G, Robertson A, Buller RM.

29510577	Loss of Actin-Based Motility Impairs Ectromelia Virus Release In Vitro but Is Not Critical to Spread In Vivo	Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is an orthopoxvirus and the causative agent of mousepox. Like other poxviruses such as variola virus (agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus and vaccinia virus (the live vaccine for smallpox), ECTV promotes actin-nucleation at the surface of infected cells during virus release. Homologs of the viral protein A36 mediate this function through phosphorylation of one or two tyrosine residues that ultimately recruit the cellular Arp2/3 actin-nucleating complex. A36 also functions in the intracellular trafficking of virus mediated by kinesin-1. Here, we describe the generation of a recombinant ECTV that is specifically disrupted in actin-based motility allowing us to examine the role of this transport step in vivo for the first time. We show that actin-based motility has a critical role in promoting the release of virus from infected cells in vitro but plays a minor role in virus spread in vivo.

24516381	The master regulator of the cellular stress response (HSF1) is critical for orthopoxvirus infection	The genus Orthopoxviridae contains a diverse group of human pathogens including monkeypox, smallpox and vaccinia. These viruses are presumed to be less dependent on host functions than other DNA viruses because they have large genomes and replicate in the cytoplasm, but a detailed understanding of the host factors required by orthopoxviruses is lacking. To address this topic, we performed an unbiased, genome-wide pooled RNAi screen targeting over 17,000 human genes to identify the host factors that support orthopoxvirus infection. We used secondary and tertiary assays to validate our screen results. One of the strongest hits was heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the ancient master regulator of the cytoprotective heat-shock response. In investigating the behavior of HSF1 during vaccinia infection, we found that HSF1 was phosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus, and increased transcription of HSF1 target genes. Activation of HSF1 was supportive for virus replication, as RNAi knockdown and HSF1 small molecule inhibition prevented orthopoxvirus infection. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional activator, inhibition of several HSF1 targets also blocked vaccinia virus replication. These data show that orthopoxviruses co-opt host transcriptional responses for their own benefit, thereby effectively extending their functional genome to include genes residing within the host DNA. The dependence on HSF1 and its chaperone network offers multiple opportunities for antiviral drug development.	16	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1003904	Filone CM, Caballero IS, Dower K, Mendillo ML, Cowley GS, Santagata S, Rozelle DK, Yen J, Rubins KH, Hacohen N, Root DE, Hensley LE, Connor J.

32745153	Ectromelia-encoded virulence factor C15 specifically inhibits antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells post peptide loading	Smallpox and monkeypox pose severe threats to human health. Other orthopoxviruses are comparably virulent in their natural hosts, including ectromelia, the cause of mousepox. Disease severity is linked to an array of immunomodulatory proteins including the B22 family, which has homologs in all pathogenic orthopoxviruses but not attenuated vaccine strains. We demonstrate that the ectromelia B22 member, C15, is necessary and sufficient for selective inhibition of CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell activation by immunogenic peptide and superantigen. Inhibition is achieved not by down-regulation of surface MHC- II or co-stimulatory protein surface expression but rather by interference with antigen presentation. The appreciable outcome is interference with CD4+ T cell synapse formation as determined by imaging studies and lipid raft disruption. Consequently, CD4+ T cell activating stimulus shifts to uninfected antigen-presenting cells that have received antigen from infected cells. This work provides insight into the immunomodulatory strategies of orthopoxviruses by elucidating a mechanism for specific targeting of CD4+ T cell activation, reflecting the importance of this cell type in control of the virus.

28747505	Insufficient Innate Immunity Contributes to the Susceptibility of the Castaneous Mouse to Orthopoxvirus Infection	The castaneous (CAST) mouse, a wild-derived inbred strain, is highly susceptible to orthopoxvirus infection by intranasal and systemic routes. The 50% lethal intraperitoneal dose of vaccinia virus (VACV) was 3 PFU for CAST mice, whereas BALB/c mice survived 106 PFU. At all times and in all organs analyzed, virus titers were higher in CAST than in BALB/c mice. In individual CAST mice, luciferase-expressing VACV was seen to replicate rapidly leading to death, whereas virus levels increased for a few days and then declined in BALB/c mice. Increases in gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were delayed and low in CAST mice compared to BALB/c mice following VACV infection or poly(I-C) inoculation, consistent with differences in innate immune responses. In addition, naive CAST mice had considerably lower numbers of NK and T cells than BALB/c mice. The percentage of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased following infection of CAST mice only after considerable virus spread, and the absolute cell numbers remained low. Administration of exogenous IFN-γ or -α to CAST mice before or during the first days of infection suppressed virus replication and prolonged survival, allowing the mice to make adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that were necessary to clear the virus after cessation of interferon treatment. Thus, insufficient innate cytokine and cellular immune responses contribute to the unique susceptibility of CAST mice to VACV, whereas the adaptive immune response can be protective only if virus replication is suppressed during the first several days of infection.IMPORTANCE Most inbred mouse strains are relatively resistant to orthopoxviruses. The castaneous (CAST) mouse is a notable exception, exhibiting extreme vulnerability to monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and vaccinia virus and thus providing a unique model for studying pathogenicity, immunity, vaccines, and antiviral drugs. To fully utilize the CAST mouse for such purposes, it is necessary to understand the basis for virus susceptibility. We showed that naive CAST mice make low IFN-γ and TNF-α responses and have low levels of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to a resistant classical inbred mouse strain. Attenuating virus replication with one or more doses of exogenous IFN-α or -γ before or during the first few days of infection enabled the development of adaptive cellular immunity and clearance of virus. Further genetic studies may reveal the basis for the low innate immunity.	9	Information Unavailable	NK cells; T cells; adaptive immunity; immune deficiency; innate immunity; interferons; poxvirus; vaccinia virus	10.1128/JVI.01042-17	Earl PL, Americo JL, Moss B.

26137812	[Mechanisms of viral emergence and interspecies transmission: the exemple of simian foamy viruses in Central Africa]	A large proportion of viral pathogens that have emerged during the last decades in humans are considered to have originated from various animal species. This is well exemplified by several recent epidemics such as those of Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian flu, Ebola, Monkeypox, and Hantaviruses. After the initial interspecies transmission per se, the viruses can disseminate into the human population through various and distinct mechanisms. Some of them are well characterized and understood, thus allowing a certain level of risk control and prevention. Surprisingly and in contrast, the initial steps that lead to the emergence of several viruses, and of their associated diseases, remain still poorly understood. Epidemiological field studies conducted in certain specific high-risk populations are thus necessary to obtain new insights into the early events of this emergence process. Human infections by simian viruses represent increasing public health concerns. Indeed, by virtue of their genetic andphysiological similarities, non-human primates (NHPs) are considered to be likely the sources of viruses that can infect humans and thus may pose a significant threat to human population. This is well illustrated by retroviruses, which have the ability to cross species, adapt to a new host and sometimes spread within these new species. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies have thus clearly showed that the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 in humans have resulted from several independent interspecies transmissions of different SIV types from Chimpanzees and African monkeys (including sooty mangabeys), respectively, probably during the first part of the last century. The situation for Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is, for certain aspects, quite comparable. Indeed, the origin of most HTLV-1 subtypes appears to be linked to interspecies transmission between STLV-1-infected monkeys and humans, followed by variable periods of evolution in the human host. In this review, after an introduction on emerging viruses, we will briefly present the results of a large epidemiological study performed in groups of Bantus and Pygmies living in villages and settlements located in the rain forest of the South region of Cameroon. These populations are living nearby the habitats of several monkeys and apes, often naturally infected by different retroviruses including SIV, STLV and simianfoamy virus. Most of the persons included in this study were hunters of such NHPs, thus at high risk of contact with infected body fluids (blood, saliva,...) during hunting activities. After reviewing the current available data on the discovery, cross-species transmission from monkeys and apes to humans of the simian foamy retroviruses, we will report the results of our study. Such infection is a unique natural model to study the different mechanisms of restriction of retroviral emergence in Humans.	2	Review	Information Unavailable	10.1016/S0001-4079(19)31387-1	Gessain A.

34949827	Molecular mimicry of NF-κB by vaccinia virus protein enables selective inhibition of antiviral responses	Infection of mammalian cells with viruses activates NF-κB to induce the expression of cytokines and chemokines and initiate an antiviral response. Here, we show that a vaccinia virus protein mimics the transactivation domain of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to inhibit selectively the expression of NF-κB-regulated genes. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that the vaccinia virus protein F14 associates with NF-κB co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and disrupts the interaction between p65 and CBP. This abrogates CBP-mediated acetylation of p65, after which it reduces promoter recruitment of the transcriptional regulator BRD4 and diminishes stimulation of NF-κB-regulated genes CXCL10 and CCL2. Recruitment of BRD4 to the promoters of NFKBIA and CXCL8 remains unaffected by either F14 or JQ1 (a competitive inhibitor of BRD4 bromodomains), indicating that BRD4 recruitment is acetylation-independent. Unlike other viral proteins that are general antagonists of NF-κB, F14 is a selective inhibitor of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. An in vivo model of infection demonstrated that F14 promotes virulence. Molecular mimicry of NF-κB may be conserved because other orthopoxviruses, including variola, monkeypox and cowpox viruses, encode orthologues of F14.

31823763	Evaluation of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2012-2015	Background: The World Health Organization recommends periodic evaluations of influenza surveillance systems to identify areas for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policymaking. However, data about the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Methods: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza sentinel surveillance system (ISSS) in DRC during 2012-2015. The performance of the system was evaluated using eight surveillance attributes: (i) data quality and completeness for key variables, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed and described using quantitative and qualitative methods. Scores for each indicator were as follows: < 60% weak performance; 60-79% moderate performance; ≥80% good performance. Results: During 2012-2015, we enrolled and tested 4339 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and 2869 patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 11 sentinel sites situated in 5 of 11 provinces. Influenza viruses were detected in 446 (10.3%) samples from patients with ILI and in 151 (5.5%) samples from patients with SARI with higher detection during December-May. Data quality and completeness was > 90% for all evaluated indicators. Other strengths of the system were timeliness, simplicity, stability and utility that scored > 70% each. Representativeness, flexibility and acceptability had moderate performance. It was reported that the ISSS contributed to: (i) a better understanding of the epidemiology, circulating patterns and proportional contribution of influenza virus among patients with ILI or SARI; (ii) acquisition of new key competences related to influenza surveillance and diagnosis; and (iii) continuous education of surveillance staff and clinicians at sentinel sites about influenza. However, due to limited resources no actions were undertaken to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza epidemics. Conclusions: The system performed overall satisfactorily and provided reliable and timely data about influenza circulation in DRC. The simplicity of the system contributed to its stability. A better use of the available data could be made to inform and promote prevention interventions especially among the most vulnerable groups.	6	Information Unavailable	Democratic Republic of Congo; Evaluation; Influenza; Surveillance	10.1186/s12889-019-8008-2	Babakazo P, Kabamba-Tshilobo J, Wemakoy EO, Lubula L, Manya LK, Ilunga BK, Disasuani W, Nkwembe E, Kavunga-Membo H, Changachanga JC, Muhemedi S, Tamfum JM, Tempia S.

29401327	Beyond the Dirty Dozen: A Proposed Methodology for Assessing Future Bioweapon Threats	Background: Defense policy planners and countermeasure developers are often faced with vexing problems involving the prioritization of resources and efforts. This is especially true in the area of Biodefense, where each new emerging infectious disease outbreak brings with it questions regarding the causative agent's potential for weaponization. Recent experience with West Nile Virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Monkeypox, and H1N1 Influenza highlights this problem. Appropriately, in each of these cases, the possibility of bioterrorism was raised, although each outbreak ultimately proved to have a natural origin. In fact, determining whether an outbreak has an unnatural origin can be quite difficult. Thus, the questions remain: could the causative agents of these and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks pose a future weaponization threat? And how great is that threat? Should precious resources be diverted from other defense efforts in order to prepare for possible hostile employment of novel diseases by belligerents? Answering such critical questions requires some form of systematic threat assessment. Methods: Through extensive collaborative work conducted within NATO's Biomedical Advisory Council, we developed a scoring matrix for evaluating the weaponization potential of the causative agents of such diseases and attempted to validate our matrix by examining the reproducibility of data using known threat agents. Our matrix included 12 attributes of a potential weapon and was provided, along with detailed scoring instructions, to 12 groups of biodefense experts in 6 NATO nations. Study participants were asked to score each of these 12 attributes on a scale of 0-3: Infectivity, Infection-to-Disease Ratio (Reliability), Predictability (& Incubation Period), Morbidity & Mortality (Virulence), Ease of Large-Scale Production & Storage, Aerosol Stability, Atmospheric Stability, Ease of Dispersal, Communicability, Prophylactic Countermeasure Availability, Therapeutic Countermeasure Availability, and Ease of Detection. Reproducibility of scoring data was assessed by examining the standard deviations (SD) of mean scores. Results: Our results were unexpected. Several familiar biothreat diseases such as anthrax and tularemia were judged, by our experts, to be less threatening than many others owing to a number of factors including ease of detection, lack of communicability, and the ready availability of countermeasures. Conversely, several toxins were judged by experts to have very high potential as threat agents owing, in part, to their reliability, virulence, and a lack of available countermeasures. Agreement among experts, as determined by lower SD about a mean score, was greater for more familiar threats. Discussion: Our study was designed to provide a concise and east-to-apply set of criteria that could be used by NATO nations to evaluate emerging infectious disease threats with respect to their weaponization potential. Our results were unexpected. We believe that a lack of appropriate weighting factors may explain these results and suggest that future studies weigh each of the 12 proposed criteria based on the intended use of the assessment data and other situational factors. We believe that the greatest value of our study lies in a codification of the attributes of a biological weapon.	13	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1093/milmed/usx004	Cieslak TJ, Kortepeter MG, Wojtyk RJ, Jansen HJ, Reyes RA, Smith JO; NATO Biological Medical Advisory Panel.

33902775	Suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm in infectious disease epidemics: a systematic review and meta-analysis	Aims: Suicide accounts for 2.2% of all years of life lost worldwide. We aimed to establish whether infectious epidemics are associated with any changes in the incidence of suicide or the period prevalence of self-harm, or thoughts of suicide or self-harm, with a secondary objective of establishing the frequency of these outcomes. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and AMED were searched from inception to 9 September 2020. Studies of infectious epidemics reporting outcomes of (a) death by suicide, (b) self-harm or (c) thoughts of suicide or self-harm were identified. A random-effects model meta-analysis for the period prevalence of thoughts of suicide or self-harm was conducted. Results: In total, 1354 studies were screened with 57 meeting eligibility criteria, of which 7 described death by suicide, 9 by self-harm, and 45 thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The observation period ranged from 1910 to 2020 and included epidemics of Spanish Flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human monkeypox, Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regarding death by suicide, data with a clear longitudinal comparison group were available for only two epidemics: SARS in Hong Kong, finding an increase in suicides among the elderly, and COVID-19 in Japan, finding no change in suicides among children and adolescents. In terms of self-harm, five studies examined emergency department attendances in epidemic and non-epidemic periods, of which four found no difference and one showed a reduction during the epidemic. In studies of thoughts of suicide or self-harm, one large survey showed a substantial increase in period prevalence compared to non-epidemic periods, but smaller studies showed no difference. As a secondary objective, a meta-analysis of thoughts of suicide and self-harm found that the pooled prevalence was 8.0% overall (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2-12.0%; 14 820 of 99 238 cases in 24 studies) over a time period of between seven days and six months. The quality assessment found 42 studies were of high quality, nine of moderate quality and six of high quality. Conclusions: There is little robust evidence on the association of infectious epidemics with suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm. There was an increase in suicides among the elderly in Hong Kong during SARS and no change in suicides among young people in Japan during COVID-19, but it is unclear how far these findings may be generalised. The development of up-to-date self-harm and suicide statistics to monitor the effect of the current pandemic is an urgent priority.	10	Meta-Analysis	epidemic; infection; self-harm; suicide; systematic review	10.1017/S2045796021000214	Rogers JP, Chesney E, Oliver D, Begum N, Saini A, Wang S, McGuire P, Fusar-Poli P, Lewis G, David AS.

32412687	Structural insight into tanapoxvirus-mediated inhibition of apoptosis	Premature programmed cell death or apoptosis of cells is a strategy utilized by multicellular organisms to counter microbial threats. Tanapoxvirus (TANV) is a large double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the poxviridae that causes mild monkeypox-like infections in humans and primates. TANV encodes for a putative apoptosis inhibitory protein 16L. We show that TANV16L is able to bind to a range of peptides spanning the BH3 motif of human proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and is able to counter growth arrest of yeast induced by human Bak and Bax. We then determined the crystal structures of TANV16L bound to three identified interactors, Bax, Bim and Puma BH3. TANV16L adopts a globular Bcl-2 fold comprising 7 α-helices and utilizes the canonical Bcl-2 binding groove to engage proapoptotic host cell Bcl-2 proteins. Unexpectedly, TANV16L is able to adopt both a monomeric and a domain-swapped dimeric topology where the α1 helix from one protomer is swapped into a neighbouring unit. Despite adopting two different oligomeric forms, the canonical ligand binding groove in TANV16L remains unchanged from monomer to domain-swapped dimer. Our results provide a structural and mechanistic basis for tanapoxvirus-mediated inhibition of host cell apoptosis and reveal the capacity of Bcl-2 proteins to adopt differential oligomeric states whilst maintaining the canonical ligand binding groove in an unchanged state.

30120818	The national and provincial burden of medically attended influenza-associated influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2013-2015	Background: Estimates of influenza-associated outpatient consultations and hospitalizations are severely limited in low- and middle-income countries, especially in Africa. Methods: We conducted active prospective surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) at 5 healthcare facilities situated in Kinshasa Province during 2013-2015. We tested upper respiratory tract samples for influenza viruses using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. We estimated age-specific numbers and rates of influenza-associated ILI outpatient consultations and SARI hospitalizations for Kinshasa Province using a combination of administrative and influenza surveillance data. These estimates were extrapolated to each of the remaining 10 provinces accounting for provincial differences in prevalence of risk factors for pneumonia and healthcare-seeking behavior. Rates were reported per 100 000 population. Results: During 2013-2015, the mean annual national number of influenza-associated ILI outpatient consultations was 1 003 212 (95% Confidence Incidence [CI]: 719 335-1 338 050 - Rate: 1205.3; 95% CI: 864.2-1607.5); 199 839 (95% CI: 153 563-254 759 - Rate: 1464.0; 95% CI: 1125.0-1866.3) among children aged <5 years and 803 374 (95% CI: 567 772-1 083 291 - Rate: 1154.5; 95% CI: 813.1-1556.8) among individuals aged ≥5 years. The mean annual national number of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations was 40 361 (95% CI: 24 014-60 514 - Rate: 48.5; 95% CI: 28.9-72.7); 25 452 (95% CI: 19 146-32 944 - Rate: 186.5; 95% CI: 140.3-241.3) among children aged <5 years and 14 909 (95% CI: 4868-27 570 - Rate: 21.4; 95% CI: 28.9-72.7) among individuals aged ≥5 years. Conclusions: The burden of influenza-associated ILI outpatient consultations and SARI hospitalizations was substantial and was highest among hospitalized children aged <5 years.	7	Information Unavailable	Democratic Republic of Congo; burden; influenza; influenza-like illness; severe acute respiratory illness	10.1111/irv.12601	Babakazo P, Lubula L, Disasuani W, Manya LK, Nkwembe E, Mitongo N, Kavunga-Membo H, Changachanga JC, Muhemedi S, Ilunga BK, Wemakoy EO, Tamfum JM, Kabamba-Tshilobo J, Tempia S.

16189015	An orally bioavailable antipoxvirus compound (ST-246) inhibits extracellular virus formation and protects mice from lethal orthopoxvirus Challenge	ST-246 is a low-molecular-weight compound (molecular weight = 376), that is potent (concentration that inhibited virus replication by 50% = 0.010 microM), selective (concentration of compound that inhibited cell viability by 50% = >40 microM), and active against multiple orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia, monkeypox, camelpox, cowpox, ectromelia (mousepox), and variola viruses. Cowpox virus variants selected in cell culture for resistance to ST-246 were found to have a single amino acid change in the V061 gene. Reengineering this change back into the wild-type cowpox virus genome conferred resistance to ST-246, suggesting that V061 is the target of ST-246 antiviral activity. The cowpox virus V061 gene is homologous to vaccinia virus F13L, which encodes a major envelope protein (p37) required for production of extracellular virus. In cell culture, ST-246 inhibited plaque formation and virus-induced cytopathic effects. In single-cycle growth assays, ST-246 reduced extracellular virus formation by 10 fold relative to untreated controls, while having little effect on the production of intracellular virus. In vivo oral administration of ST-246 protected BALB/c mice from lethal infection, following intranasal inoculation with 10x 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of vaccinia virus strain IHD-J. ST-246-treated mice that survived infection acquired protective immunity and were resistant to subsequent challenge with a lethal dose (10x LD(50)) of vaccinia virus. Orally administered ST-246 also protected A/NCr mice from lethal infection, following intranasal inoculation with 40,000x LD(50) of ectromelia virus. Infectious virus titers at day 8 postinfection in liver, spleen, and lung from ST-246-treated animals were below the limits of detection (<10 PFU/ml). In contrast, mean virus titers in liver, spleen, and lung tissues from placebo-treated mice were 6.2 x 10(7), 5.2 x 10(7), and 1.8 x 10(5) PFU/ml, respectively. Finally, oral administration of ST-246 inhibited vaccinia virus-induced tail lesions in Naval Medical Research Institute mice inoculated via the tail vein. Taken together, these results validate F13L as an antiviral target and demonstrate that an inhibitor of extracellular virus formation can protect mice from orthopoxvirus-induced disease.	116	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1128/JVI.79.20.13139-13149.2005	Yang G, Pevear DC, Davies MH, Collett MS, Bailey T, Rippen S, Barone L, Burns C, Rhodes G, Tohan S, Huggins JW, Baker RO, Buller RL, Touchette E, Waller K, Schriewer J, Neyts J, DeClercq E, Jones K, Hruby D, Jordan R.

26325270	Structural and Functional Characterization of Anti-A33 Antibodies Reveal a Potent Cross-Species Orthopoxviruses Neutralizer	Vaccinia virus A33 is an extracellular enveloped virus (EEV)-specific type II membrane glycoprotein that is essential for efficient EEV formation and long-range viral spread within the host. A33 is a target for neutralizing antibody responses against EEV. In this study, we produced seven murine anti-A33 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by immunizing mice with live VACV, followed by boosting with the soluble A33 homodimeric ectodomain. Five A33 specific MAbs were capable of neutralizing EEV in the presence of complement. All MAbs bind to conformational epitopes on A33 but not to linear peptides. To identify the epitopes, we have adetermined the crystal structures of three representative neutralizing MAbs in complex with A33. We have further determined the binding kinetics for each of the three antibodies to wild-type A33, as well as to engineered A33 that contained single alanine substitutions within the epitopes of the three crystallized antibodies. While the Fab of both MAbs A2C7 and A20G2 binds to a single A33 subunit, the Fab from MAb A27D7 binds to both A33 subunits simultaneously. A27D7 binding is resistant to single alanine substitutions within the A33 epitope. A27D7 also demonstrated high-affinity binding with recombinant A33 protein that mimics other orthopoxvirus strains in the A27D7 epitope, such as ectromelia, monkeypox, and cowpox virus, suggesting that A27D7 is a potent cross-neutralizer. Finally, we confirmed that A27D7 protects mice against a lethal challenge with ectromelia virus.	6	Comparative Study	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005148	Matho MH, Schlossman A, Meng X, Benhnia MR, Kaever T, Buller M, Doronin K, Parker S, Peters B, Crotty S, Xiang Y, Zajonc DM.

30480506	Assessing the Surveillance System for Priority Zoonotic Diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2017	High-functioning communicable disease surveillance systems are critical for public health preparedness. Countries that cannot quickly detect and contain diseases are a risk to the global community. The ability of all countries to comply with the International Health Regulations is paramount for global health security. Zoonotic diseases can be particularly dangerous for humans. We conducted a surveillance system assessment of institutional and individual capacity in Kinshasa and Haut Katanga provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for nationally identified priority zoonotic diseases (eg, viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF], yellow fever, rabies, monkeypox, and influenza monitored through acute respiratory infections). Data were collected from 79 health workers responsible for disease surveillance at 2 provincial health offices, 9 health zone offices, 9 general reference hospitals, and 18 health centers and communities. A set of questionnaires was used to assess health worker training in disease surveillance methods; knowledge of case definitions; availability of materials and tools to support timely case detection, reporting, and data interpretation; timeliness and completeness of reporting; and supervision from health authorities. We found that health workers either had not been recently or ever trained in surveillance methods and that their knowledge of case definitions was low. Timeliness and completeness of weekly notification of epidemic-prone diseases was generally well performed, but the lack of available standardized reporting forms and archive of completed forms affected the quality of data collected. Lessons learned from our assessment can be used for targeted strengthening efforts to improve global health security.	4	Information Unavailable	Communicable diseases; Health workers; Outbreaks; Surveillance; Viral hemorrhagic fever; Zoonotic diseases; the Democratic Republic of the Congo	10.1089/hs.2018.0060	Stolka KB, Ngoyi BF, Grimes KEL, Hemingway-Foday JJ, Lubula L, Nzanzu Magazani A, Bikuku J, Mossoko M, Manya Kitoto L, Mpangi Bashilebo S, Lufwa Maya D, Kebela Ilunga B, Rhea S, MacDonald PDM.

26381398	A Multiplex PCR/LDR Assay for the Simultaneous Identification of Category A Infectious Pathogens: Agents of Viral Hemorrhagic Fever and Variola Virus	CDC designated category A infectious agents pose a major risk to national security and require special action for public health preparedness. They include viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) syndrome as well as variola virus, the agent of smallpox. VHF is characterized by hemorrhage and fever with multi-organ failure leading to high morbidity and mortality. Smallpox, a prior scourge, has been eradicated for decades, making it a particularly serious threat if released nefariously in the essentially non-immune world population. Early detection of the causative agents, and the ability to distinguish them from other pathogens, is essential to contain outbreaks, implement proper control measures, and prevent morbidity and mortality. We have developed a multiplex detection assay that uses several species-specific PCR primers to generate amplicons from multiple pathogens; these are then targeted in a ligase detection reaction (LDR). The resultant fluorescently-labeled ligation products are detected on a universal array enabling simultaneous identification of the pathogens. The assay was evaluated on 32 different isolates associated with VHF (ebolavirus, marburgvirus, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Lassa fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Dengue virus, and Yellow fever virus) as well as variola virus and vaccinia virus (the agent of smallpox and its vaccine strain, respectively). The assay was able to detect all viruses tested, including 8 sequences representative of different variola virus strains from the CDC repository. It does not cross react with other emerging zoonoses such as monkeypox virus or cowpox virus, or six flaviviruses tested (St. Louis encephalitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Powassan virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus).	10	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1371/journal.pone.0138484	Das S, Rundell MS, Mirza AH, Pingle MR, Shigyo K, Garrison AR, Paragas J, Smith SK, Olson VA, Larone DH, Spitzer ED, Barany F, Golightly LM.

31593747	Use of live Variola virus to determine whether CAST/EiJ mice are a suitable surrogate animal model for human smallpox	Numerous animal models of systemic orthopoxvirus disease have been developed to evaluate therapeutics against variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox. These animal models do not resemble the disease presentation in human smallpox and most used surrogate Orthopoxviruses. A rodent model using VARV has a multitude of advantages, and previous investigations identified the CAST/EiJ mouse as highly susceptible to monkeypox virus infection, making it of interest to determine if these rodents are also susceptible to VARV infection. In this study, we inoculated CAST/EiJ mice with a range of VARV doses (102-106 plaque forming units). Some animals had detectable viable VARV from the oropharynx between days 3 and 12 post inoculation. Despite evidence of disease, the CAST/EiJ mouse does not provide a model for clinical smallpox due to mild signs of morbidity and limited skin lesions. However, in contrast to previous rodent models using VARV challenge (i.e. prairie dogs and SCID mice), a robust immune response was observed in the CAST/EiJ mice (measured by Immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). This is an advantage of this model for the study of VARV and presents a unique potential for the study of the immunomodulatory pathways following VARV infection.	2	Information Unavailable	CAST/EiJ mice; Immune response; Orthopoxvirus; Smallpox; Variola virus	10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197772	Gallardo-Romero NF, Hutson CL, Carroll D, Kondas AV, Salzer JS, Dietz-Ostergaard S, Smith S, Hudson P, Olson V, Damon I.

21439856	CD94 is essential for NK cell-mediated resistance to a lethal viral disease	It is well established that natural killer (NK) cells confer resistance to many viral diseases, but in only a few instances the molecular mechanisms whereby NK cells recognize virus-infected cells are known. Here we show that CD94, a molecule preferentially expressed by NK cells, is essential for the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to mousepox, a disease caused by the Orthopoxvirus ectromelia virus. Ectromelia virus-infected cells expressing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib molecule Qa-1(b) are specifically recognized by the activating receptor formed by CD94 and NKG2E. Because CD94-NKG2 receptors and their ligands are highly conserved in rodents and humans, a similar mechanism may exist during human infections with the smallpox and monkeypox viruses, which are highly homologous to ectromelia virus.	56	Information Unavailable	Information Unavailable	10.1016/j.immuni.2011.02.015	Fang M, Orr MT, Spee P, Egebjerg T, Lanier LL, Sigal LJ.

30301229	Whole Genome Characterization of Orthopoxvirus (OPV) Abatino, a Zoonotic Virus Representing a Putative Novel Clade of Old World Orthopoxviruses	Orthopoxviruses (OPVs) are diffused over the complete Eurasian continent, but previously described strains are mostly from northern Europe, and few infections have been reported from Italy. Here we present the extended genomic characterization of OPV Abatino, a novel OPV isolated in Italy from an infected Tonkean macaque, with zoonotic potential. Phylogenetic analysis based on 102 conserved OPV genes (core gene set) showed that OPV Abatino is most closely related to the Ectromelia virus species (ECTV), although placed on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, bringing substantial support to the hypothesis that this strain may be part of a novel OPV clade. Extending the analysis to the entire set of genes (coding sequences, CDS) further substantiated this hypothesis. In fact the genome of OPV Abatino included more CDS than ECTV; most of the extra genes (mainly located in the terminal genome regions), showed the highest similarity with cowpox virus (CPXV); however vaccinia virus (VACV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV) were the closest OPV for certain CDS. These findings suggest that OPV Abatino could be the result of complex evolutionary events, diverging from any other previously described OPV, and may indicate that previously reported cases in Italy could represent the tip of the iceberg yet to be explored.	8	Information Unavailable	OPV Abatino; core gene set; cowpox virus; ectromelia virus; orthopoxvirus; phylogenetic tree	10.3390/v10100546	Gruber CEM, Giombini E, Selleri M, Tausch SH, Andrusch A, Tyshaieva A, Cardeti G, Lorenzetti R, De Marco L, Carletti F, Nitsche A, Capobianchi MR, Ippolito G, Autorino GL, Castilletti C.
